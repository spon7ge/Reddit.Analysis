    "## Sentiment Analysis of r/NBA Posts Using BERT\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook performs **sentiment analysis** on Reddit post components — specifically the **title**, **selftext**, and **comments** — using the `cardiffnlp/twitter-roberta-base-sentiment` model from Hugging Face.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Extract and clean text data from Reddit posts\n",
    "* Apply a BERT-based sentiment model to each part:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * `Title`: the post’s headline\n",
    "  * `Selftext`: the post’s body text\n",
    "  * `Comments`: all user replies concatenated per post\n",
    "* Analyze the sentiment of each component individually (Positive, Neutral, Negative)\n",
    "* Handle edge cases (e.g. empty texts or inference errors)\n",
    "* Optional: visualize or summarize sentiment distributions\n",
    "\n",
    "This pipeline enables fine-grained analysis of how different parts of Reddit posts vary in sentiment, supporting downstream tasks like user behavior modeling, topic tracking, or content moderation."

You want him, cool. You like Steve, I love Steve.”\\nKyrie emphasizes that even if Nash wasn’t his first choice, he’s willing to be supportive — even enthusiastic — for the sake of unity.\\n\\t•\\t“Ya know what I’m saying, cool.”\\nHe repeats “cool” as a way of downplaying resistance and indicating he’s letting it slide.\\n\\t•\\t“As a younger brother, I’m like, OK, I don’t care you want Steve to coach.”\\nKyrie frames himself in a deferential, younger sibling role to KD, expressing that he’s stepping aside and not making a fuss about the decision.\\n\\nSummary:\\n\\nKyrie is making it clear that hiring Steve Nash wasn’t his idea or preference, but out of respect for Kevin Durant — who endorsed Nash — he accepted and even supported the decision.

He's not good at either of these things and was not drafted for them. \\n\\n2. His hands were absolutely a concern. I watched him fumble a few passes. He WAS drafted to catch lobs and interior passes, putting pressure in the paint. This was a bummer to see, and I was surprised because he looked like he had this stuff down at Duke\\n\\n3. His presence as a rim protector is massive. We'll see how he looks against full NBA rosters, but in SL they just didn't contest him. I was very happy to see that. \\n\\n4. His perimeter defense was solid for a 5. He's shown that he has potential to be an elite defensive anchor. \\n\\n5. His rebounding struggles are hopefully due to him being 18 and simply not at his full strength yet. We saw the same thing happen to him against Houston in the final 4, and they had a lot of older players on that team. \\n\\nOverall, the primary concern is the drops.

You let Beal play out at least one more season until his contract is more tradable. It wouldn\\'t be fun, but that\\'s the way it goes when the owner does dumb stuff because he thinks he\\'s smarter than everyone. When you mess up like he did, there are no \"good\" choices - just degrees of \"less bad\". When you over-indulge in sweets, at some point, you need to eat your vegetables.\\n\\nBut \"building the right way\" takes patience and luck. And the less patient you are, the less luck you\\'ll have.\\n\\nFor example \"tread water and hope something breaks your way\"...\\n\\nWhat would that even look like? PHX looks like a team that - if everything goes incredibly right for them - might win 40 games. In the West this season, that\\'s what, the 10th seed? Absolute best case scenario, PHX makes the play-in and gets swept by OKC. As a Suns fan, would you be happy with that result? Especially since getting that result means delaying building something better in the future? Because doing that means using assets and moves to \"improve\" right now rather than roll improvements over to the future. And \"improve\" is in quotes because is 40 wins instead of 37 actually meaningfully better? It\\'s like being stuck in traffic and thinking things are much better because you\\'re now creeping along the highway at 40 mph instead of 37. That\\'s still too slow to get you where you want to go in a timely manner. When thinking about the future - beyond the season right in front of you - would you look back and say \"wow, I\\'m really glad we didn\\'t make any moves that would have compromised that 40 win season\"? \\n\\nAs for Booker - does paying him $70mil/yr actually help their team? I don\\'t mean in the abstract \"is Booker a winning player?\" I like him and think he is a winning player. But PHX has screwed up their roster, cap flexibility and draft situation for years to come.  They aren\\'t realistically competing for anything meaningful for years with the trajectory they\\'re on right now. That\\'s the true context under which they are operating. So does having Devin Booker actually get them any closer to being a contender, or not? I would say definitely not. They will be \"lucky\" to even make the play-in with him this year.

I know there are people hurting, and I want to acknowledge the weight of everything that has happened. My heart goes out to everyone who has been impacted, and I mean that sincerely.\\n\\nI want to express my deepest gratitude to everyone who has stood by me, believed in me, and offered their love and support through this incredibly difficult time. Your encouragement has been a source of strength that I cannot fully put into words.\\n\\nBasketball has been my lifeline for as long as I can remember. It gave a kid from St. Louis a chance to see the world and to create a life beyond anything I could have imagined. Through the game, I met mentors, teammates, and fans who believed in me even when I struggled to believe in myself. I carry that gratitude with me every single day.\\n\\nMore than anything, I am a father. I love my two children with every part of me. They are my reason for everything. My greatest hope is that they grow into kind, strong, and compassionate people. I want them to be proud of the man I am working to become. Being away from them is heartbreaking, but I know I have to use this time to reflect, grow, and prepare myself to be the best version of the father they deserve.\\n\\nThis journey has been painful, humbling, and eye-opening. I was sentenced to eight years under Oregon’s Measure 11, a mandatory minimum sentencing law that removes judicial discretion for certain charges.\\n\\nThis sentence was handed down despite my having no prior criminal history, no record of violence, and despite testimony and evidence that painted a far more complex picture than what was ultimately accepted in court. Measure 11 leaves no room for consideration of the circumstances involved. In any case, it removed the opportunity for a fair and personalized evaluation.\\n\\nThat night involved alcohol consumption by both parties, something acknowledged by all sides. Key witnesses, including individuals close to the situation, testified that events did not unfold the way they were later portrayed. The timeline and details introduced during trial raised serious questions, questions that, unfortunately, went unaddressed under the constraints of the law as it stands.\\n\\nThis was not a violent or predatory act. It was a situation involving impaired judgment on both sides, which has been mischaracterized in ways that do not reflect the truth.\\n\\nTo everyone who truly knows me, you know the kind of man I am. I have always tried to live with love and kindness. I am gentle. I show up for my people. I care deeply for those around me. Even in this dark moment, I still believe in the power of grace and redemption. I believe in second chances, and I am going to work every day to earn mine.\\n\\nI want to be clear: I maintain my innocence.\\n\\nI have never violated anyone, and I will never stop fighting to prove that. I believe in truth, and I believe that justice is still possible. This fight is not over. I remain committed to clearing my name and pursuing the justice I know is possible.\\n\\nTo my mother – I am so sorry. I know this has hurt you deeply, and the pain you’re carrying weighs heavily on my heart. You’ve been my rock through every stage of life, and I carry a heavy heart knowing this has brought you sadness. Please know that I’m doing everything I can to make you proud again. Your strength, your love, and your faith in me mean more than I can ever express.\\n\\nTo my brother, sisters, nieces, and nephew, I’m so sorry we have to go through this again, but we will get through this. I love y’all with everything in me.\\n\\nI know not everyone will understand. But to those who continue to stand with me, who see my heart and believe in who I truly am, thank you.

Our cultural and economic standards simply don\\'t support the level of relegation needed to make the \"let the best play for/against the best, and to each level their own!\" model that so many internationally popular sports follow.',\n",

       "  'selftext': \"A lot of people suggest that the supermax should only count as the max in terms of capspace, in order to not punish teams that draft well. I think this doesn't go far enough. I know as a fan, I often love players that my team drafted, even if they are just roleplayers.  \\n  \\n So in my opinion, what should be the rule is the following: If a player spends the majority of their rookie season at your club (this means players traded at draft or shortly after, count towards the club they spend most of their rookie season at), 20% (this is a made up number. its possible 15% is better or even 25% is better. whatever im not a numbers guy) of their future Salary does not count against capspace for that club. If they get traded, the whole salary counts against capspace in their future club. I even think this should be a career long thing, so that encourages lost sons to come home, like lillard in portland right now, or Lebron returning to Cleaveland, because that is usually a pretty cool things for fans as well.\\n\\nThis encourages teams to keep drafted players, because they can have a better player for their percentage of capspace. Say a player is 10 million worth, well you can pay him 12 and it will only still count as 10, so he has every reason to want to stay at your club, or you might just pay him the 10 he would get elsewhere but its only counted as about 8 million. It makes it so that teams will have a certain loyalty even towards role players and it will make later picks more valuable, because even if you don't hit a superstar, getting a solid benchplayer is still rewarded, and makes it so your team is more flexible in terms of capspace, than if you just have a lot of traded players. And it will make all picks a more valuable tradepiece in general, which I think is actually a good thing.\\n\\nFrom a fan perspective, it helps keeps guys you grow to love at your club. Toumani Camara probably shouldn't be getting a supermax, but as a fan, I want to keep him at my Trailblazers. Not just because he is a great player, but because I have grown to really love him.\\n\\nAnother posible Idea, is that there could be a loyalty bonus, that players that spend X years at a club get their capspace reduced as well. Though I think its more important, to make sure drafted players of all skill get a bonus to their club, because it really encourages drafting well and it encourages loyalty, from the fans, the players and the club!\\n\\nEdit: because i keep seeing comments about this, i want to reiterate, that I am absolutely open to 20% being too high. It was just a number I thought of and threw out there. People who understand Cap math better than me can probably find a better value. Maybe 15% or 10%.

Well, Cam is a good dude and an awesome scorer, but his game is based on dribbling, isos and backing smaller guards down. His game is incompatible with what the trio of Jordi, Marks and Tsai want to build in Brooklyn. That doesn't mean that Marks would not want Cam on the team, but it means that he's not going to go out of his way to pay him above market value. \\n\\nThe fact that no teams currently have the cap space to offer Thomas a contract that he'd be happy to sign (except the Nets), means that Marks doesn't even have to match these offers (CT is a restricted free agent), so he's free to low-ball Thomas.\\n\\nI get why that makes Cam so frustrated. I think he deserves to be paid around the 20-25 mil/year mark (and he thinks it's probably more than that), but he's just not going to get it on this market and Marks is not going to give him that sweetheart deal, because Thomas doesn't look like a player that has a place in the new Brooklyn system.\\n\\nThe contract that was offered to Cam (2 years at 15 mil AAV) is a very low offer for a young player of his caliber. The length is also telling, because the Nets are currently set up to have another huge salary release in the summer of 2027. That year MPJ's and Terrance Mann's contracts expire and we should once again have the highest cap space available in the league. Just in time for a free agent class consisting of Jokić and Antetokounmpo. \\n\\nThat's clearly the plan and that's why Cam only got offered a 2-year deal. Marks wants to see if CT can adapt to the new system. If he can't, he'll increase our cap space in 2027. If he somehow can, then that's the actual year he would get paid by the Nets to stay on and be the 6-year veteran for all the young guns.\",\n",

Those are completely different players. Cam has more in common with Sexton or Jordan Clarkson as 1D combo guards than someone who can orchestrate an offense so there's 0 reason to even bring them up when comparing to Cam. Even when Harden was coming off the bench he was a great playmaker for being a 2 guard who styled his play off of Ginobili more than being a Lou Will type gunner. Cam is one dimensional because his only skill is scoring, something that you either have to be elite at on a level like KD (who still brings more as a defender and playmaker than Cam).

You jump to talk about offense of primary ball handlers but the guys who you mentioned are **playmakers** when Cam is not. \\n\\nDeMar becoming a better playmaker is an anomaly compared to most guards who start out being poor playmakers but DeMar had a significantly lower usage level than Cam did through his first 4 seasons to be a playmaker. Making a statement that he can be a slightly smaller DeMar is ignoring the fact that a big part of what makes Deebo a better playmaker today is his size and athleticism allowing him to draw people in with the drive and see over many of the guards defending him with his size. The size is also relevant for him because DeMar can and has lined up at 2-4 in the past few years while Cam being a small guard who's not a playmaker is confined to 1 position which limits the teammates he can play with.\\n\\nNAW is more valuable because he was cast as a 6th man scorer type earlier in his career, improved in defense along with being 6'5 being able to guard 1-3, and scaled down his offensive role to be someone who can be a connector and do 3 and D wing play with a bit of scaling up when presented with advantages.

I was just looking at random teams the Lakers played to find a comparison, and Mehmet Okur in 09 was assisted on 57%, his career percent was 60%. And not saying Okur was the creator Pau was, Pau was a better passer, created more pressure in the post, still scored more, but just that his volume wasn’t especially high. Lamar could be a ball handler and creator, but not at a very high volume and the knock on Lamar was always consistency. Ariza, Meta, Fisher, and a young and often injured Bynum are the other starters and primary minute getters during those runs. There was a lot of times where action just wasn’t happening, and Kobe ends up as the release valve in those circumstances. And it led to two years (08 & 09) of elite offenses that held up well in the playoffs, including bumping back up to a playoff offensive rating 4 points higher than their regular season in 2010. \\n\\nThat dynamic shows its head again in the clutch. If you have 4 seconds or whatever left on an inbound, should you try to run a pin down for Fisher, or dump it in to Pau and see if he can beat his man from wherever you can get an entry pass to in that time? I don’t think the Lakers were constructed to force shots that are resilient to defensive attention \\n\\nFG%/TS% is one thing, including in the clutch, but how it fits into your teams offense speaks more to your impact and importance imo',\n",

description of someones play style than he plays like he has airpods inlamelo plays bball like we all daydreamed we would play like when we were little super flashy faking people out crazy passes looking a little crazy but it works and i love itjust wish hed stay healthyhes fun to watch at his bestlol at timesi really hope him and brandon miller can be healthy for the season them plus kon could make some serious strides this yeartook a break from watching slam dunk and saw thisfeels like im watching the live action versionone of the most fun players in the legaue i really hope he can stay healthy because some the things he does are just crazybro plays nba basketball for contenthes gen z personified and its good for the leaguelamelo is the neymar of the nbathat is an insane highlight package hopefully he stays healthy this year and takes the next step such a fun playerthis sped up video gives me migrainesand ball cuts the lead to wish we were in the timeline where he got drafted by the warriorslol that airball is so fucking funnyhe plays like he got airpod inop is the playback speed faster in this videoyou have to wonder if he had stability and a team that can teach him how to play the right way how much better he could be he has one of the most naturally talented players in the league incredible feel for the game but completely unharnessed he really has never been taught to play winning basketball the right wayah to be againsomething about the way lamelo moves pisses me offi remember very vividly when people used to talk shit about cade when the roster sucked then everyone was surprised at how good he actually was when the team wasnt bad and he wasnt injured i wouldnt be surprised if this exact thing happens with lamelothe rest of the time hes hurthornets are the nbas aau teampeople who hate on lamelo lack joy in their lifeget this man some good ankles and a competent front officesomeone said he plays like he has headphones in and man that is so accuratecant recall which podcast but someone said lamelo plays like he has airpods in i gotta agreethe gost greatest of some timessome roads lead to him games a year he is allnba another he is average then the rest he is in street clotheswould be the face of this league for younger audiences if he wasnt injured all the time regardless of being on a winninglosing teameasily the most entertaining basketball player active today in my opinion he does this shit so much that a lot of the cool things he does just gets lost in all the noise really think he got snubbed for the all star team this yeartravel on the stepbackentertaining but not winning basketball hell forever be a flashy aau kidhes not my favorite player but he is fun to watch he plays do free some may say reckless entertaining nonethelessjulian newman in shambleslamelo plays like the imaginary version of you did in the driveway as a kidone of the most fun players to watch in the leaguenglif your team is not contending hes prob one of the most fun players to watchwhy the fuck does this video look like a video gameand why is no one talking about itlamelo without injuries and a good team would get mvp praise problem is it seems impossible to get bothas a laker fan lamelo is who we thought lonzo would betheres a tagalog word kangkarot that describes a flailing awkward style of play if its used in a basketball setting its often used jokingly to refer to someone who isnt all that great at playing but needlessly gives exaggerated effort in every play and is all over the courtlamelo is what you get when you take a kangkarot basketball player and push his height and talent sliders all the way up and its hilarious to watchso many carries and travels lollove his style looks like hes just having a good timeso much talent being wasted in charlottemight be the only player to have his high school gimmick perfectly work in the nba its so good to watchwhats crazy is his cherry picking chino hills playstyle somehow made it all the way to the nba and not only just being able to do it but dominate with ithes very good but he plays like that annoying mf whos in every pickup game all over america melos just way more successful with that style kinda hard to watch for me sometimes personallylamelo is a beast hes just in charlotte and nobody cares about the team and they arent goodlamelo ball was a problemgood entertainment losing basketballif only his brother didnt wear those stupid bbb shoesreminds me of white chocolatelooks pretty slick when it works but that circus shit would piss me off when it goes wronghe and steph would have been fun to watch play togetherhe plays like someone has never told him to stop doing what hes doing and i love itcould you imagine this dude with the spurs or heat instead of the hornetssomething something winning basketball something something dudes fun to watchfor anyone saying he has never made the playoffs lets dig into the charlotte hornetsbobcats history according to google of course the og charlotte hornets made it to the playoffs times in years the charlotte bobcats made it to the playoffs twice in years the rebranded charlotte hornets made it to the playoffs once present day thats by far least amount of playoff appearances by a team that has atleast years of existence in the league not to mention the many coaches lamelo ball has had and the ownership well need i say more imagine if he got drafted to san antonio or the lakers etcgoing rotten in charlotte smhput him on a solid franchisei saw nothing there that jason williams white chocolate didnt do on a nightly basis its a big yawn for me unless it translates to wins which clearly it doesntbrings a tear to my eyehe playing like i do on k with max ball handling and ball lmaotrying to find these times is like trying to figure out when a show starts on betcan you imagine how much tylenol his high school coach must have taken daily its completely unclear to me whether going to charlotte with no expectation of winning was the best or worst thing for his careerdrunken master fri mean hes got moves but i dont fancy it like i do kyrie ai and so onthese were the highlights i was hoping to see with lonzo joining the lakers showtime i know theyre different players and there were much more pressure for lonzo being the first and all the hype around bbb would love to see lamelo go to a larger marketthis guy is dangerousso to bill simmonsi really dislike his shot formi dont even follow the hornets but i would love if this franchise got its shit together with lamelo at the helmfun to watch but gotta start winningman he couldve be such a star if he could stay healthy and just be a little more serious both on and off the courtthe problem is that for every one of those highlights he has two bad playseasily the best ball in the nbaall the while shooting percent from the field lolempty caloriesfunny we all disliked lavars dumb antics but the kids won us over they the real deal if only they could stay healthytoo bad he cant stay healthy to save his life one of the worst contracts in the leaguesuch a fun player to watchlamelo plays like a k myplayer with all the cheesiest animations activated the way he plays is like of point guards onlinehes gonna have an insane highlight reel by the time he retires just by the nature of his gamei want him on my team in an all star game not sure if i want to build around him for regular season or playoffs but the man highlights like mfi see what people mean about him playing like he has air pods ingod please somehow get the hornets into the playoffs that is what highlight reels tend to showthe announcer deserves a best supporting actor award for this highlight lamelo is a highlight machine his style of play might be the only thing putting butts in seats for the moribund hornetsmost of the time he looks so smooth a fluid at other times just kinda plain goofyhe doesnt play winning basketball unserious playerpistol pete reincarnatedsuch a unique shot too but ultimately i think he might always be a guy with incredible skill but you cant build a team around him hope im wronghe plays like how people like playing call of duty these daysu cant tell me that dude aint showtimethat first pass was fucking absurd lmao wowand to think he was doing this in a park at chino hills with his brothers while wearing those ankle breaking bbb shoeshe is literally the best merge of streetball to nba ive ever seenand mix tape ishthe definition of ooo that boy nice player in my headsuch an unorthodox way of shooting are we whats with the sped up videocan someone explain to me why all the highlights here have crazy aspect ratios even the hakeemshaq post was still slightly cut off is it something on my enddoes melo still play i didnt see much of him last year playoff run winning record played games do the hornets play the super mario world castle theme oftenlamelo and kyrie are probably the best ball handlers in the game rn these dudes make it look effortlessthis is evil steph curryif he could stay healthy manlol loving this commentator his energy and enthusiasm is amazinghis handles are insanehes just a streetball playerreminds me a bit of jason williams used to love watching him playhe plays like the most annoying players in k its very impressivei honestly think he could take over as the face of the league if he stayed healthyhad help and got more serious at basketball none the lessdude is out there just enjoying life so i cant blame him that video of him driving his go kart on the roof was hilarious hes just enjoying lifethat first one is a great clipamazing moves sexy pass giant air ballbest pg in the eastthose two oops at the end were sicklamelo is talented and has lived up his expectations on the other hand the lakers picked lonzo over tatum and spida is laughableplease stay healthy this yearawesome skills but only two of these plays got anything positive out of being flashy highlights the rest were examples of him unnecessarily raising the difficulty for himself and making a super routine or open play a tough shotseems like better examples could have been chosen for a highlight reel intended to make him look goodi have the same amount of playoff appearances as himhow the heck was he left off the allstar teamssuper talented losing playerif he was coachable this dude would be on another levelmmmm hornets hexagon court designsa perfectly fitting title it even leaves the question of if that has a positive meaning or not openglock petethose alley oops at the end are sickthat damn air ball dawwwgggghow does he even make that pass at his feel for the game is extraterrestrial literally but i just hate how unpolished it looks out thereok i cannot stand the nba it really is fucking garbage but sometimes sometimes theres some shit that actually stands out curry like years ago and this clip fuck son incredibleman that announcer is cool for like seconds then is just annoying no way i could listen to a whole game of himin terms of ceiling i think hes top in the leagueaiiiiirrrrballlllhe has to be one of the best ball handler currently playing who gives him a run for his money kyrie whos a bit older now and less flashy was more of a with luka on the team anywaynahshades of pistol petethat first one made me actually laugh out loudlamelo ball plays like he has his shoelaces untiedyall think this looks goodnot sure if this is super obvious to everyone else but just thought id point out that these clips are sped up its not a ton so its not incredibly noticeable but its definitely sped up take the first clip for example in the first clip the game clock starts at and ends at that second clip ends while the play head is still on secondsdrunken masterwild magic sorcererim sorry but its the same clips over and over again over what years hes been in the leagueman i cant stand that announcer it seems so forcedflashy for wins lmao yall can keep the flash under the leg alley oop in the defenders face and this man has not been arrested for thatgod damn i remember when the ball family was a meme on here and now they doin this shitlonzo didnt have these handles but was as good of a basketball player overall if he had never been hurt i think a lot of his teams would have been serious contendersda fuq is this shit realif he was just a little more seriousyoure not supposed to move like that if melo is a legit lmelo meaning lick it in spanish makes it more gorgshame hes on a team that nobody watches or cares about hes crazy talentednow show all the turn overs on the same passes lolif he put more effort on defense hed be a legit player and leader but it seems currently he cares more about stats and highlights maybe just needs a change of scenery and go to an organization with structure and expectationsplease get this man off the hornets lol they dont deserve himflashy zoomer bball from melolove itall flash no substance destined to be on mid teams his entire careerlamelo plays ridiculous basketball in every sense of the wordif he doesnt get out of charolette at the next possible chance he will probably have brad beal john wall type career insanely talented but will never learn to be a winner with this team and if he decides to ring chase later in his career he wont actually have much to offeri would love to see how his game would translate in the playoffsempty calories farming max contracts and will never win in the playoffsif the nba were a pickup basketball game he would be the goathe is but i dont think any of this is sustainable or consistent and it definitely doesnt win gameshes a bum looking for a checkanother level of losing agreedempty caloriesnothing special here a worse version of jason williams or jason kiddall style no substancemelo play like a toxic k pg with his takeoverno hate on lamelo but everything wrong with the hornets team is between their earsaesthetic baller little substanceall flash no substance he would drive me nuts as a hornets fanah i remember these announcers absolute jokes these fellasi really wish this man had durable ankles hes fun as hell to watchi mean people are impressed by this but kobe would have had this entire highlight reel in a single game minus the passes obviously one of the most talented guys in the league for sure id love to see him in a different environmenthornets deserve some playoff success because nobody gets more hyped to watch them play than the commentatorswould love to see this guy stay healthy hes just soo loose out there having funhes a ballers baller hopefully he can get healthy for an extended period so we can see more than just a glimpsewould love to see this dude in a winning situationnow imagine he didnt shoot worse than league avghes fun to watch but hell shoot like on a regular basis with some flashy highlights in betweenon another level at timesnone of those times are during the playoffsgive this guy a proper organization and its a different narrativeimagine him in a good team and be healthy at the same time wowhim not being able to play winning basketball is saving us from half of the rookies trying this shit constantly and creating the most toxic game possible looks cool but he will never win at a high level pulling this shitthey need to give dude some serious pills hes to good to be goofing around all the timeone of the best league pass players to watch so entertaininglol he plays hella uglynot doing anything jason williams didnt do better yrs agolmao no ringsthis is basically just the second coming of jason williams all time great highlight real incredibly fun to watch never know what you are going to get because hes so insanely talentedbut not one of the first point guards you would take to win on your team probably only barely inside the top that airball is hilariousthe spongebob oohh is one of my favoritesi feel like that perfectly exemplified what lamelo puts up with and the situation in charlottehornets have the best home announcer hands down finds tony martin you gotta hit that noperfect pass then wooshthat perfectly sums up the help melo usually has throughout his whole time here this sub loves to hate on lamelo ball because they think hes not a winning player but they dont actually watch the hornets like us sickosyes hes flashy and sometimes his shit selection is iffy but hes a team player who prefers to get his teammates involved but they either suck or are injured all the time so he almost has no choice but to chuck up shots because hes the only who who can actually do anything with the basketballif i had to choose between a somewhat open jt thor or bryce mcgowens on the wing or a lamelo ball whos doubled teamed because defenses know hes the only threat so he chucks up some unlikely prayer from feet im usually more confident in choice number bthankfully our roster looks better this season and basketball gods willing our team some actual health for the first time in nearly years then melo should be able to revert to some more off ball play which hes good at and passing to his guys more i guarantee hes much happier having brandon miller and kon knueppel as his wings rather than cody martin still love ya dude and bryce mcgowensmy team traded quentin grimes for that manthe commentators reaction is so funny you gotta hit it eeeuuoohhi didnt expect that lmaooooothe call was legendary ohhhhhhhhhhhhohhhhwhat a fuckin waste he ended up on such a worthless piece of shit franchise we should be watching this dude compete for rings its unfaira clip full of amazing athleticism and the topupvoted nba fan finds the fault in a guy who is x better at everything than theyll ever be classic nba fanbasethis is so accurate he pulls some chino hills shit at least once a game at the nba level incredibly fun to have on ones team really hope he can stay healthy and get a little more serious and efficient in the half courtits shocking to see a viral hs player doing the same things in the nba its like if julian newman was still doing that stupid dribble but against nba pgshe really does still have that annoying high school unbalanced lanky body ass dribble spammer with your nephews first jumper form moveset except it just works every time its kind of magical to see nothing about his bag should work but it doesi think nate duncan had the best evaluation of him when he was drafted saying that all the things he does well will look better in the nba because his style doesnt work well with shitty teammates like he more than anyone needs to be surrounded with greater talent to amplify what he does wellits pretty awesome anyone that loves basketball should really want a full season and playoff debut for himand like hs only playing games a year he is so fun to watch for us in charlotte but the hornets could actually be good and try to win this year i just hope he can stay on the court also i know people say this all the time and usually hate it but lamelo would truly get whistled all the time years ago and certainly years ago things change and high is cool but it is really tough to not get caught up in lb is standing at half court carrying every time he pounds the ball for no reason or doing a double step back and then jumping into a dribble to blow by a guy no idea how to defend that and the shoti spent years a hs ref and it never really leaves you but he is really talented for sure and if they dont call itusually players dont change a lot in their tendencies and strengthsi had the exact same thought while watching this like it doesnt always work as well as it did but when it does its just as wild as the footage we used to see back thenand i love him for that plays with so much flair and freedom he makes bball look funhe reminds me of the kid who has all the skill in the world but will never listen to what any coach tells him to doi cant really explain itproceeds to explain itthis entire thread has some heaters in it and this made me chuckleanother one i heard thats good is he plays like hes wearing slidesi cant remember who said it but when the allstar voting was going on some podcaster or journalist said lamelo plays every game like its an allstar game or something along those lines and i thought that was pretty on pointhe plays like a kick streamer that somehow got to touch space jams talentstealing ball and got magic johnsonsthats why i enjoy watching him he isnt always super efficient but hes always having fun and vibingi still try to play like this at the y but im times slower and miss everything but in my head it looks goodwas at the bucks game where he scored it was insane and so fun to watchthis is why his average fan contingent is roughly years oldyep but loses by id dispute that it works it makes for fun highlights but he isnt doing them any favors playing the way he doeslamelo is great for the game i hope the hornets have a good year so we can see him in the playoffs with brandon millerthe modern day jason williams off the elbowdoes it workdoes it work ill wager that lamelo will never be the best player on a playoff teamhed be a top pg if he was healthy imolmao evenand not only because he missed time he was shooting a subpar in the plus games and overall for his career and we clowned jalen green for similar numbers he played definitely could have been a lot more efficient overall in the games he did playlamelo is never healthy unforteven at max healthy they wont make playoffsslam dunk is so goodbut its bad for the charlotte hornetsits not good for the league hahahas an old as fuck person if somebody on the team im rooting for did this shit in the nba finals id lose my fucking mind this is like lance stephenson x but the hornets are never gonna have to worry about that so carry onnot even close for years neymar easily cleared everyone except messi and crlamelo atm is not even top in his position and doesnt look like hell ever be top my mind has been blown this feelsso accurategreat shouthes the second white chocolate of the nbaneymar was the rd best player in the world lamelo is barely a top pgpls dont disrespect neymar like this againyeah this a bullshitass videoyou can see the clock in every clip im not a lamelo fan but this is just an odd commentwouldnt have half these highlights if he wasnt the no optionhe wouldnt last a day in that locker room lol draymond would do something to himor at least the timeline where his body wasnt starting to break down by the time he entered the nbakerr despises young playersits the same thing with kobe their whole lives talent alone has been good enough for these guys to get by until they get to the nbathey stick to what they know works but there are too established in their methods to be taughtthese are grade a amazing highlightsthis is not what winning ball looks likeshoots like shawn marion and joakim noahhes moving jumpers looks like hes doing it for the first time every time but he just hits so many lolno im with you he moves like a year old kid who just learned one move off a highlight mixtape and cant stop spamming it its crazy that it somehow manages to work hes something elsehali has a little bit of that too its like one of those weird characters in street fighter whose moves involve licking their opponents to death you cant play good with them but when you play someone who can they whoop your assmoves like hes doing an impersonation of someone elsethis and streetball and its beautifulyeah lamelo can undoubtedly be selfish out there but hes actually a willing passer like look at the first play in the video he got his teammate a wide open shot and didnt hesitate to swing itlamelo would have to take a big leap like cade did to get back into the conversation i dont see itwait so you dont think highlights like op posted or jason williams highlights for that matter are fun to watch because their teams didnt win i feel sorry for you thats a sad way to enjoy basketballhe plays nothing like jason kidd im not even a lemelo fan but hes a better player than jason williamsat in charlotte lol what a bum rightthunder fans were just waiting for the chance to become insufferablethats mostly on charlotte being charlottei didnt take long for okc to have the most insufferable fanbase in the nba thats pretty impressive given the amount of bandwagon lakers and warriors fanshe was bamboozled by lamelothat should have been the first and final clipi busted out laughing right out the gate when i first saw this post my legouuuu tonyhands down the most entertaining and that subreddit also is absolute gold the fans know the ceiling is the floor and the floor is the ceiling they get excited for new spaldings over there number bshame jt thor doesnt seem to be panning out him and dragan bender should have been allstars just by name alonehow does one select what shits they takeif he could stay healthy he would be an insane playerid say most nba fans knew this entire time that lamelo is on a lone island of greatness surrounded by an ocean of scrubs im not sure why people hate on him other than being the son of his obnoxious father clearly he can play the organization just hasnt succeeded in getting the poor guy any helptbf nico was trying to get an asset because grimes was going to walk but yeah trading him for caleb martin is roughgreat fleece by moreyno we traded for his brother caleb martinshut upand a high nd round picklet it out big fellowhes like if lance stephenson played like lance stephenson thinks he playshe will look better once yall put more talent around him for surei still cant believe the warriors were so in love with the smell of their own farts that they passed up on this dudehes always been serious i wont take the slanderits gotta be tough sometimes for his psyche this dude so used to winning its gotta take a toll on you with all this losing then again mil cures all depressionkon is gonna compliment him so nicelyi guess if its fun to lose all the time then he is fun to have on your teamwatching newman play legit competition was always so fucking funny since the defender just looked so bored and pissed off hahais julian newman still in th gradeyou coud already see he was cooked when he played any decent schoollamelo was always a really good prospect he just got hated on by people that like to pretend playing flashy means you cant be a good basketball playerit works because im sure everyone not a hornets player is expecting a normal moveset then he does some shit you havent seen since and mixtapes and your brain is trying to correct in real time except it just works every timei dont watch the hornets but does it really its hard for me not to imagine lemelo having some goofy turnoversi just realized ive never watched him play i dont watch their games on tv and the one time i saw charlotte come to my city he was outman i cant believe its been seasons and hes had playoff games injuries sucki dont envy the ref that would have to blow the whistle on these plays but some of these are crazythe point is most of those flashy highschool guards cant do shit in the nba lamelo is still pulling out insane highlights against nba talent once or twice a game he makes nba defenders look like highschool foolsi admit i started off as hating on a lot of these because they seemed so unnecessary but they got progressively better the shamgod was niceedit you said heater not hater whoops have lebron in sandals at homei heard someone on a podcast say he plays like the crowd is nothing but hot girlsless cheering and more teammates saying bro you dont need to shoot that shotyes hes perfect for a team that doesnt want to win really but make moneylol this is accurate im this highlight reel looks terrible to me over dribbling terrible step backs rec league flashy passeswatch that cody martin clip again and consider that guys like cody and josh green were some of charlottes better scoring options for much of last season brandon miller missed games tre mann missed mark williams missed grant williams missed nick smith jr played miles bridges tidjane salaun josh green seth curry moussa diabate nobody else played more than lamelo looked just fine and led them to a winning record when he had a relatively healthy decent young team a few years backthats why i cant understand people saying he is better then ben simmons was at the same age lamelo is a great player he will have a better career than ben but hes not what ben was as a prospect or first years in the leaguesga doncic tyrese brunson cade yeah i could see him at him or traeand not or bruh fymlmao is like the secret ball family sage modelmaolo ballrofl if you willwe won games last year step at a timedont know why youre getting downvoted youre right this teams front court rotation is arguably the worst in basketball if everyones healthy i think were a top offense this year though we will also be a bottom defense too lolwarriors might not make the playoffs either my manhes unfortunately one of very few things they have going for them they were without him last year which is just incrediblewould they be in a better position if melo was lame insteadits juat the ankles we all hate saying if but if he can finally stay on the court he truly is a nightmare of a talentnah hornets are probably fine with just selling ton of jerseys they know who they arehes currently the only good aspect of the hornetsabsolute fucking bullshit loll dumb fucking commentits only bad because hes been injured or his team isalfalfa in alfalfa out am i righttgimme deletedlamelo dribbles so fast that bro thinks the video is sped up dude it is sped up not a lot so its not super obvious but take the first clip for example clock starts at and ends at and the play head is still at seconds at the end of the clip that is a second clip that took at most seconds to play backplus you can just see the way all the people in the background are walking around its not naturalhe would still have insane highlights especially next to steph and klay all those years lamelo has never changed his play style since th grade for better or worse he would be doing all this anywhereyeah bro would be on the bench with his playstyle ngl hes fun to watch but it wouldnt work in gs at allidk about that curry does some wild shit and kerr is ok with it as long as it contributes to winningi mean if the warriors draft lamelo theyd probably trade him eventually hes not really a system playersure hed work well as a firebrand off the bench im just not sure how long hed put up with that role even as a rookiethe big thing is they would have gotten a hell of a lot more for lamelo than they got for wisemanmelo could play with harden mj and kobe at the same time and hed still be the option loland what one move is thati think i would like haliburton if he didnt move and shoot the way he doestbf hes only selfish bc he needs to be him shooting a foot three is a better shot than a wideopen shot by pretty much anyone on our team not named miles miller or mann and to make matters worse the last two only played and games last yearnopenope dude is always injured thats not a real playerbuild your team instead of making sorry excuses for this scraggly lil bumflair up goofwhatever pinoy get in linenah man imagine shooting a and seeing your mirror image running at you on the close out lmfao i dont remember when that play was but it was probably the first season those two ever played against each othertony martin would demolish mj in vhe meant tobycolbytony rr martinlol sorry i heard that in a schaffrillas video and have been dying to use that ever sinceshit selectionits very contextualwould have thought that a pistons fan would relate to having to choose what lesser of two evils a fan of a bad team would rather have to deal withthe old organization for sure but i have faith in this new organization theyve done great getting better talent and more assets in the last years theyve been running things just hope it starts to pay off sooner rather than latercaleb was a good role player for a finals teamif he gets back to that level hes a fine assetthis is cody martin not caleb martin caleb was almost an ecf mvp when he was in miami butler won it but the vote was like in favor of butler over caleb caleb put up like points in the closeout game i thinkthis might be the most accurate description of him ive seen to this dayactual lolso hes like the michael jordan of lance stephensonsshould have drafted franz insteaddo you think he wouldve fit in a curryklay rotation i think wiseman is still the way to go just sucked he forgot to play basketballif my own farts smelled like stephen curry i wouldnt take a point guard eitherthat dude does not care about winning that much i remember them being in the play in and getting blown out he was just laughing it up on the benchit can be fun watching him and not fun losing both things can be true theres actually no inconsistency thereyour franchise goat is ringlessif julin newman needs to learn how to drive and play in the paint like tony parker that way he can be a legit threat for the defenseright i promise you in a serious gameplanscouting setting he gets chewed up an spit out with this shitwell okay not every time it was hyperbole you get what i meanit works more than it realistically should i watched one game where he was on fire and it was absolutely electric made me an instant fansame i was watching this shoot around the other day and i was like oh these guys actually seem kind of interesting i think a little over the top razzle dazzle in the playoffs would be intriguing to watch the problem is the risk reward of doing something flashy and getting totally fucking clowned on for it especially in high stakes games is tough its one thing when youre up regular season but like you said i dont be watching charlotte games like that regular season so i never see this guy and frankly when they play the teams i do watch i just dont clock ball so i dont know is he good he shoots per game last season and fg pt so he cant be that badabsolutely at a some point it is like trying to stop a speeder when everyone is driving over and stop any one rightfully it is somewhat unfair to themit feels wrong to call what is never called and feels wrong to see a guy literally carry the ball times in a row unguarded waiting to initiate or set a pick and hold both defenders it just isnt how bb was played when i played oh well i am sure mikan looked at kareem or jerry west and said something similar and they cruised magic and jordanhelps that he grew to be we all suck and they do it too so it evens out lolyou callwatching this all i was thinking was i now understand why his pt percentage is so low lolhe has skill for sure just needs to rein it in a little bitim not hating on him im hating on the franchise hes definitely a balleri think trae is a bit more efficient so ill take trae right now but its pretty closetop ahahah what you hornets fans smoking we are talking about the freaking hornets right not houston hornetsif you think a team with steph draymond and jimmy wont make the playoff then youre just being a silly boy lolit very easily could have been without him two of those three wins were actively and blatantly ranked by our opponents the brk and utah games late in the season stand out as two of the worst finishes ive ever seen from an opponent to the point where they had to be on purposeironically the other was a blowout win against the pacers lolhe will get hurt every year i dont think they have anything going for themhomie im pretty sure if we had prime lebron we would still be a or seed at the end of the daythe hornets would be a top seed if lamelo backed the ball down from half court like mark jacksonwe as a society are so fucking cooked when people cant tell some obviously manipulated video for what it is watch the game clock and the videos playtime and get back to me you can hear it in the announcers voices and see it in the movements of everyone else or try slowing down the video to and you might see itim not sure he pulls this stuff and it goes sideways you dont think kerr yanks him off the floor kerr has little tolerance and will condition you to play a role or bench you in favor of vet min players or two way players like anthony lamb thats not a hypothetical its what happens thats not even mentioning balls question marks on defenseedit yall im not saying kerr is bad just saying hes tasked to prioritize winning hes not letting someone like melo play as free as he does in zeroexpectations charlotte hes proven it with how he has a short leash with our young talentsbruh remember those videos where he cherrypicked the entire game and just scored layups and then the title was lamelo scored points would golden state have been able to give him a max contract golden state would have been able to play through the games a year he misses more than charlotte has been able tohe stole your girl lolit was im pretty sure which iirc was calebs first season on the heatis anyone else having a hard time understanding thisill never forgive him lolbut lol its nothes like jason williams fun to watch but is he ever going to win anythinghes the michael jordan of white chocolatesid rather have franz than lamelo tbhor halli that was my pick oh welltheres a world where the warriors drafted franz and sengun instead of kuminga and moody and im so glad we dont live therewasnt franz a different draft class they passed on him for kumingahard to forget something you never knewbrother its a number two overall pick guard versus an ultra raw big man you take the best player available and figure out how to make it work you can always trade players you only get so many chances to draft star level players they made jordan poole work for a title i think lamelo ball could make it work with two of the best off ball players ever look his he plays very free flowing pass first he also has similar ankle issues to curry seems like a no brainer he could come in for curry at times and do the same things hes an elite shooter too or be on the court with either setting the up for easy shotsof course hed fit in their championship runs were won on the back of their small ball death lineup a guy that could take some on ball responsibilities off of curry with good playmaking and provides good spacing is exactly what they needed its what makes dray so valuable offensively despite his poor shooting wiseman was always the wrong pick even without the benefit of hindsighthindsight is wiseman was a huge bustwith that kinda talent you make it workidk poole somehow made it work and the fact that hes a lot taller would have helped their line ups a lot i think it would have workedyou take the best player available when you have the second overall pick but heywhat can he do hes on the poverty hornetsi dont think someone who got cut from a junior college team will ever be a threat for the defensei mean you are literally watching him pull these moves off on live season nba games he really does actually pull them off on the highest possible setting as mad as it looksyeah i got you i guess what i meant was more like whats the ratio of sweet highlights to shaqtin a fool momentshelps that hes extremely skilled tooafter a certain point shooting mechanics get more difficult the taller you get being makes shooting harderits also in part because we just had no shooters last season too he shoots better when he has guys on the roster that can also shoot if the team is healthy this season i think his splits are better big if though lolagreed most of the oftinjured players responsible for the lack of success are leftover from the previous regime the new owners are making moves and seem serious about winning so maybe theyll put a better product on the floor and lamelo will have some healthier seasonssteph is dray is jimmy is steph and jimmy missed a ton of time last year one injury and yall are toast the west is way too good now if by some miracle everyone stays healthy and jimmy stays on his best behavior sure i can see yall making the playoffs but a lot has to go rightdid he play in the game against us where beasely failed to box out the rebound and we lost with like second leftethical hoopskerr actually had a much worse version of lamelo in jordan poole and played him a ton of minutesthis is a crazy take about the coach that let an entire team off leash to affect the biggest changes in the nba since the late schanges that now dominate the modern gamelike what the fuck are you watchingthat was garbage but he has clearly shown over the last years he can give your favorite players and teams he would have been fine next to stephthats a good question but i think so and maybeeeee he misses less time next to steph who is really still running the show who knows all i know is they won with jordan poole playing great they definitely could have won with lamelonah its just peak offseason when we glaze this little shitrabbit for some crosseyed summer league passes damnill never forget him hes still the more handsome martin twinhave you seen him play in the gleague nick stauskas was looking like he was having a brain aneurysm watching him kill ants with the balli love lance but he is a player that needs the right conditions to be successfuli think jason has a chipbetter player contributes more to winningthey passed on him for wiseman freak athlete who showed ability to step out and hit a as a teenager coming out of the covid chaos not that hard to see why he was drafted high after years of complaints they need an actual center turns out he just cant keep up in the bbiq department meanwhile lamelo ended up as advertised an insane ball handler with size who can be careless and inefficient turns out hes banged up a lot tooits not like theres ever been precedence of an ultra raw big man going second overall and not working out lights cigarthis is when the hornets were actually competitive tho most guys who are serious about winning usually dont look happy when their team is getting blown out in the most important game of the seasonits not the highest possible setting dude its regular season games of modern nba against the hornies often once theyre already well out of contention hes injured so goddamn much its hardly like there a ton of repeat divisional matchups where theres like skin in the gameim not saying its nothing im not even saying he couldnt adjust to it but this entire thread is so packed full of glazing and if people dont think end of season basketball for playoff contention and then the actual playoffs are two extremely distinct levels of play than a typical tuesday in uptowni gotta bridge to sellhes not the first obscenely talentedskilled nba star who may pan out to absolutely nothingsurprisingly low he really does not make a fool of himself as much as youd expect him with that little brother that plays too much k ass bagwell see that applies to every team steph played games you bozo jimmy missed time in miami cus they refused to sign him to big contract so he sat out by intention again you bozoyou should be more worried about lamelo who is only and has never been healthy has playoff games under his belt zero playoff games browas that the ot gamewe went vs you guys our wins were with melo our losses were without himfree rangethat was the season curry was injured then bc klay was injured jp still got pushed into a lesser bench role even after a hot start to the season bc of klays return and continued to do so regardless of how obvious klay was struggling it was all the drama around jp thinking he proved himself and wanting a starting role same thing that led to curry coming off the bench in the playoffs upon his return to show jp coming off the bench is acceptableand remember in not saying he gets dnps im saying he plays less free than charlotte you dont think so honestlyyeah but there is a different lamelo did this stuff on a losing team bad turn overs from triple spin moves i would bet money a coach like kerr or spolstra would bench him coach mazzula would take him out back probablydude ive watched all of it yes he unlocked a team when he came in new with no preconceived notions and didnt solidify his coding stylehes a great coach still but if you think hes still out there experimenting and all that youre not watching hes trying to navigate the real nba as he saysare you telling me he doesnt have a short leash with the young players that players like mm and jk were not yanked bc they had championship aspirations youth has been yoyod in favor of journey men because kerr didnt want to waste a season developing platters while curry is playingyou could totally see the difference the season curry was injured because kerr was more tolerant that season and have youth the leeway to explore their gameget that glaze out your eyes bc this is not summer leaguewould have been traded for a serviceable center though oh well cant really complain as the dubs won one with wiseman riding the bench anyways plus as you said it was a covid year so everybody gets a passcompetitve losing the play inive never been worried about lameloi think hed be forced to play a more controlled version of what he does yeah im just making the point that poole was given room to be himself on the court i think kerr has more patience for that if youre helping the team win they relied on poole in the playoffs because they needed his scoringand player giving bad turn overs anywhere is getting benched if theres another option thats how shit works kerr isnt some ridiculous task mastercoach coaches to win news at big if truemuch more competitive than theyve been of lateyea i agree hed get minutes and play its just the root of this comment thread was if hed have as many of these highlights and i dont think so as youre saying hed be forced to play a more controlled styleim not commenting if he will or wont contribute to winning or anything but if melo didnt adapt itd be a tense situationno one is saying kerr is bad were just saying he gets to play less free than lowexpectations charlottei think people understand kerr is trying to prioritize winning over allowing a rookie to play free and showboatyea i agree thats why im saying he plays less free than in charlottethats not saying much',\n",
       " 'took the franchise years to recover from this lmaoone of the most hilarious parts here which isnt seen in this video was when dwight tried to get shitty with a reporter and the reporter just basically laughed in his faceif you claim to have all these sources then who are they stan said ithe said whatstan just said you wanted him firedbruh when all the mics were raised above van gundys head to get howards responsewatching this when it broke was the craziest thing ever hard to imagine something like this happens todaylike shams would have to be standing next to the both of them just to confirm the news was truevan gundy stood on business here great professionalismdid anyone else have the curb theme play in their head at some point hahhahalso the if they wanna fire me at ill go home and find something to do and have a good day im not worried about that at all what im worried about is o clock tonight ya know are we gonna be able to guard carmelo anthony that concerns the hell out of me quote is so baller hahahgame kind of passed him by and he was a bad gm but ill always love svgdwight a bitchcommon carmelo anthony respectprobably did it on purposemichael yeah im glad you called ryan is being a little bitch again ryan im on michael michael whats up my brothadwight has always been a piece of shitis dave ping here the guy that started this bsactually your coach just verified it was not in fact bs loli remember way back seeing an interview after maybe winning the first round of the playoffs talking all that this is all thanks to god and jesus stuff my bs alarm was blaring if only i had mortgaged my house to bet the over on number of baby mothersdamn i didnt see this at the time ive always just viewed dwight as a beast on defense can dunk it from anywhere lob threat dominant rebounder gay off court this explains a lot why a lot of people dont like him but honestly he was just exposed this is what lebron kd harden and others do all the time in todays gamesure took a while for orlando to recover from this years damn dwight low key deserves his flowers for dwightmarehe kept us entertained when social media wasnt really active back then it was hilarious watching him change his mind each day lol years later and still seeing the same speculation and comments as the week it happened has anyone with real behind the scene insights come out to give the true storyin some ways this was the end of dwight howard stan gets fired then the back injury the lakers trade kobe running him out of la his underwhelming houston years harden ran him out of there and then the journeyman tour he took year role player renaissance championship being the counterpoint you can almost draw his demise back to this very moment the look on his face when he realizes he has been exposed is incredible truly a villain arc that didnt leave him as a decorated villain just a sad journeyman coach killerthe fall off of dwight after orlando is so badassuming dwight made the request why would upper management tell svg about it if they werent going to fire him seems obvious that something like that was gonna futher the riftdwightmarenba coach babysitter kindergarten teacher elementary school teacher middle school teacher high school teacher all in onedwight always loved svg as a person but thought that they needed another coach to take the team to the next level nothing personal just businessdwight gave his side of the story and said the media overexaggerated what happeneddeletedget me outta heredwight is corny for thati never realized it before but shaq was righti remember these days dwight use to piss me off in interviews lmao he would seem to me like he wouldnt take things seriouslyshaq and dwight of the greatest centers to play the game but complete divas would have also done well in the wnba and wwethat quick exit by stan but its just the nature of the business the players carry more weight because its easier to replace the coach than it is to replace a star playeri watched that shit live it was wildthe diet pepsi such theateri mean yeah nba players are like this just look at kd off the court a literal bumdwight doesnt get enough flak for being an immature manbaby for the entirety of his career hall of fame talent that peaked four years into the nbathis sub taking stan van gundys side because he looks like them when in reality hes being extremely unprofessional and talking to the media for no reasonhard to believe this was years ago and no one can tell me otherwisewhat a shame d turned out to be a bitch it was cool seeing them make that run thois stan drinking a coorsthis current magic team could benefit with van gundy in my opinionwhite man who isnt good at his job publicly throws his black employee under the bus for correctly criticizing him black guy then acts appropriately in front of the same publici can see why everyone in here thinks dwight is the bad guy s nba fan base is the worst fan base in sports paolo and franz are their savioursgive some respect to the fourniergordonvucevic big three feels like a scene straight out of a sitcom lolthey recoveredi grew up a huge magic fan im taking going to a game in every playoff series during the s including the nba finals vs houston and you know what fuck em thats karma kicking them in the ass for having such scumbags owning the team and i went from loving to having the magic in the mid to late s when i realized the devos family were awful people that was easy before betsy devos and eric prince entered the picture fuck orlando may they have championship blue balls for decades to comeorlando has really had one of the longest rebuilds of all time but i guess it was all worth itfired svg and still traded dwight for nothingwas this captured on another videoreporter im just telling you what he saiddwight and im just telling youeveryone lol i thought he was sitting down until he walked awaythe orlando front office was dumb as hell was for telling svg what dwight said what could possibly be gained from that now one of them has to goand you look dumb as hell to other superstars if they go speak to the front office privately the front office will publicize ithe didnt give a fuck props to him he was over iti like both van gundys but stan especially always seems like one of the better human beings associated with the league dwights a fucking prick for how he handled thisbur howard didnt clock itsvg is a real one always appreciate his commentary he and jeff love the game like nobodys businessi thought he was about to say at oclock i gotta go deal with the mrs or something like that hahawhen he walks away right before the reporters can ask dwight why stan just said dwight wants him firedi always loved him just for his strong desires to form a fucking wallits interesting that were just now seeing that coaching tree probably fizzle out thibs adapted a little better but the van gundy blueprint did a lot of floor raising through the s until it became completely outdated the brothers are probably done as hcs thibs may well be clifford probably wont get another hc gig the s are finally in the pasthe was one of the best coaches weve ever had and dwight fucked it upone of the hardest pics dribbling was cleanteams doing the coaches as gms move was always wild to me way too much on one individuals plate i dont think its ever worked in the modern erasoft tooyou thinkive said for years that i basically stopped watching the nba and started casually following it around this point after the magic fired svg the best coach in franchise history at dwights request and dwight didnt even resign with the magic that offseasoneven more when the magic realized he wasnt going to resign and wanted to trade him at the deadline to at least get some assets in return for him dwight refused to waive his no trade clausehe was a petty piece of garbage who set back the franchise well over a decadehe could not have come across as more of a piece of shit in this exchange wtf dwightfans always say reporters are making stuff up maybe the national reporters make stuff up but the beat reporters usually know more than they can verifythe nba is more like the boys where theres a lot more hidden crazy stuff than there is made up stuffgay off court lolin a vacuum sure but this aint a vacuum dwight is an idiot for many many reasonsulegend that youinjuriesinside the nba had a whole segment on thisbasically they would want to know if someone wanted them fired instead of being kept secrets from but the professionalism of svg to share that to the public they didnt agree withwhich is ridiculous because that team way over performed their second best player was jameer nelson and they went to the finals whats a new coach gonna dodid they stan says right there that upper management confirmed the storyhow does one exaggerate a binary situation either he asked them to fire svg or he didntwhat the fuck is a martinezi think he gets he the appropriate amount of flak considering his legacy is routinely dragged through mud and he gets talked about like he was american gobert in his prime when he nearly won a championship as the franchise playerafter his top snub people just erased all this and his shit stints everywhere after houston until the bubblediet pepsi unfortunatelyi can think of countless teams that thought the same thing only to fire him and coaches of similar caliber in yearsi mean once magic makes the finals paolo is heading to lasounds like a show id watchdj augustin would like a wordmagic gordon was funid give him a for his tenure with you guysthe office vibesflair upthey basically own half the city where i live makes it very hard to keep your money out of their pocketscry some more wait till you hear how many billionaire owners in the nba and across sports are truly shitty people you will crawl into a hole and diei mean have you looked at detroitof all time they really rebuilt from made the playoffs then had another short year rebuildthe full video includes itpart of this same interview should be on youtube somewhereyou should watch the inside the nba discussion on this it was before shaq became super pissy about dwight toostan said he heard iti didnt hear nothinwere talking about what you saidsvg might have had his own sources and dwight might have been dumb enough to blab it about with stan nearby dwight was infamously obliviousthe heat booted him to win a championship with his team and he was tough enough to stick around and even thrivewhat im worried about is o clock tonight ya know cheers is onas a schlubby white guy his handles are an inspirationi dont think thibs is cooked yet coaching is that dudes entire life i think he gets another shot especially because i dont see the knicks really progressing any further without himlove the oos and awws from the spectators here xdhes just a lil nasty sometimesdeletedi mean if im keepin in a hundo that guy just layed out my exact framework for when i think about dwight i mean far be it for me to concern myself where a man lays his wood and all thoyeah that was surprising they were fortunate to get the celtics without kg but they throttled the cavs in the ecf the lakers were a terrible match up for them in the finals thoughbecause binary situation dont exist and context always matters i dont know the situation here but it could be range of thing like if x doesnt happen fire him or it could be something like trade y or fire himhe said he didntthis joke is so tired lolonce he does that seattle will be getting a team and dejounte paulo kevin porter are all gonna get drafted to the expansion a man can dream rightwe got mo bamba without ever making to the finalshe helped steal game against the raptors in the first round seriesraptors destroyer dj augustin fournier toolove him greatly quality guardhe was great for me in fantasy in his final year thereflair uptheyve done everything they can to fuck over michigan their work to kill unions in michigan is why i started hating them initially and theyve only gotten and done worseyeah but the devos have been next level shitty for decades greed thats willing hurt everything in their pathesand sacramento do they even qualify as a rebuild theyve been in the gutter for like years post the webberpeja era and have torn it down like times overlast time orlando won rounds in the playoffs was last time pistons did it was thats not that bad compared to the nbas gutterlast time nets did it was last time kings did it was last time sixers did it was making the playoffs in the nba is equivalent to showing up to the third grade and not eating the tasty looking crayonsdwight comes off such a tooldwight such a douche in this onei mean he said he heard from people in management right from the topone of the biggest superstars in the league asked for me to be fired and top management told me sookay so your front office is shitty and you like to leak info to the presswhatever you can put together put it togetherhe gets the same criticism everywhere he goes hes going to need to utilize his bench more to stay in the leaguei would bet a lot of money on him being the coach of the kings in monthsand i like doug i just think hes going to be a victim of ownership expectations vs actual roster talenthey hes only humannow imagine being a mavs fan and while deservingly so weve been hearing nothing but this for months anytime a player is doing decentyeah why would he go to la when hes waiting for the seattle expansion teamjokewhen in actuality theyre going to be knocked out by detroit a few years in a row before he goes to lacant beat thatkevin porter jrthat moment was a freaking oasis in the desert for us lmao you have no idea how loud i yelled when he nailed that three ill try to find it but there was a watch party where magic fans were going crazy toocrotch destroyer fournieri wish wed try to rebuild and draft great players only way for a team like us to actually become competitive whereas rn were just a play in team at besti mean sac had a pretty great and if they were in the east that year as a seed they easily make in past rd the west is just always very deep there have been years where the east was arguably more top heavy but the west is consistently deeper for whatever reasonin the east toohe was a total tool but he became a bit more humble by the end of his careerits hard not to when you think your swagger can overcome complete and utter flounderingi hate to be this guy but almost all of the american aau superstars are complete divas its not just dwight its pretty much everyone who made the leap from star recruit to nba starter largely toolsthis is an absurd take thibs has his flaws of course but there are at least a dozen franchises that would be thrilled with the success he brings even with all his flawslol nah its still so recent so people are still gonna clown but that magic franchise has been around for almost years and in that time span has had two star players go to la two in years lmao the joke just doesnt make sensehopefully a lot of these dudes who have been told yes to every idea theyve had gain perspective on the world post retirement the bubble complaints in for example brutalits nice that dwight had at least a redemption arc became humble and won a ring to top off his careerfor some players unfortunately it just took too long for them like meloyoung men in their s it happens ask anyone in the military over you might say he powerbottomed outhow many superstar players have the magic had in that spanjust a lil nasty thinkin about that van gundy is pretty much of their star playerstwo in yearsshaq penny mcgrady hill howarddamn i didnt know leading the league in scoring isnt good enough to be considered a star playerfuck orlando but you had prime penny young shaq dwight tmac crippled grant hill post vertigo steve francis ben wallace but play bo outlaw insteadif you count paolo franz they have i said superstar if everyone of a teams superstars in years go to la its enough of a trend for it to be a jokeben wallace was the starting center and was traded for grant hilldid tmac go to la dipshitnah youre wrongwallace played mostly in orlando amaechi and doleac played the wallace started more games but outlaw played more minutes and i definitely remember the trade i had always wished wed have sent detroit outlaw insteadthat was honestly one of my favorite magic teams darrell armstrong its still one of my all time favoritestmac didnt even make the second round with the magic one of those years he didnt even make the playoffsid strongly argue that to be a superstar you have to have a genuine claim to being the best player in the league and i dont see how he did in orlando when kobe shaq tim duncan kevin garnett dirk nowitski exist tmac was certainly an incredible player but he did not really have a claim to being the number one player and he never even won a single playoff seriesabout whatsaying tmac wasnt a superstar is some dumb ass textbook backtracking opinion now invalidlol youre a suns fani just dont consider him to be a superstar i think expecting a superstar to win at least one playoff series in his career is valid a player that didnt even make the playoffs during one of his few years with the magic is certainly not a superstarsorry didnt make the playoffs is underselling it the magic had the worst record in the east with t macyeah steve nash was our last superstar what of itsuns are trash and you guys dont deserve book',\n",
       " 'luka magic indeedthe mavs have a bright future aheadluka highlights got me typing this with one handso fucking goodthe bamboozle with the fake layup and he did the fake glance to gafford at the same time to discombobulate fools furtherstupid fat boymaan i miss luka dishing to pj and gaff remember the first game after those trades where they both clickedalmost blocked the pass with his facegafford like oh i thought that was for me okwemby did say this game against luka was his welcome to the nba momentassuming this is his first gameyall aint ready for ozempic lukathis mavs team was so fucking good im so sad about it all over againwemby was looking like an inflatable tube manthose passes are so satisfying i was once playing a game and got stuffed on a play same situation a couple plays later and instead of getting stuffed did a no look pass behind my head to my friend that was following behind didnt get blocked and we got the basket got a smile from the guy who would have blocked me that was years agoluka made that look easy against a perennial defender like wembywhy is he in a mavericks jersey is this aialmost decapitated his ass loljust insane u guys remember when the mavs traded this dude to la me toowembys biggest obstacle near the basket is literally the backboard he only hops and flattens his palm against it kinda crazylook at how easily and quickly wemby touches the backboardluka went on to play at this level for the rest of the season averaging a season and leading his team to the finals his insane stats and gameplay would ultimately be the deciding factor on the mvp raceimagine trading luka aahhahhahahanightmare fuelim definitely gonna miss luka that clippers series last year when pj was staring down the whole clip bench got luka cheesing so hard and was probably thinking finally got some dawgs on my side nico you suck dudemy god luka clips with the mavs still hits like daggersthis highlight wouldve been crazy if he passed that a millisecond slower and beamed wemby right in the facethats what spacing doessometimes i just laugh when cp tries to contest shots at this age it just doesnt matter when youre closing out to someone inches tallerseeing cp trying to block pj is kinda funny tbhon the other side cp at this age being capable to close out the shot after a pass like that shows how people around here that accused him to being washed dont know how difficult is play defense in nbaits impressive how lukas teammates pretty much always come through and make the shot after these crazy passesi audibly gasped thanks nicoman i was so fucking excited for this season off a finals run with visible improvements i thought wed be wcf locks for surefuck nicoi remember how i used to be mindblown by rondos passes back when he was still on the celtics but after watching luka this guys doing magic esque shit every gamethanks now im sadnew fan here luka played for the mavsluka use to play for the mavswould have blocked the pass if he wasnt so stupidly skinny when will he learnthere was such a high chance of hitting wemby in the face the only reason it didnt happen is because he leaned his head back slightlythats travel before the shottoo soonhahahahahah fuck you youre a wizards fan lolnot just the fake layup but the look to gafford so that even if he drops it off the defense would think its going to gafford that keeps cp a step closer to the paint and makes it a letter rotation and contesteven gafford thought he was getting the passde gaulle is in tears tearsi firmly remember that first game after the deadline where we blew okc out by like and both of pjs and gaffords first points as mavericks were alley oopswas wondering about pjs contract apparently its a year could be interestinghis hand accidentally hitting the bottom of the backboard like it was an inconvenience cause hes so tall can never relatewembys very first nba game was vs the luka mavs yesbut chris paul is in the clip who joined the spurs in wembys second seasoni think pj and gaff were not mavs players when wemby played his debut against the mavsnah his first game was in san antonio against the mavsthat was the game lively outplayed himand they got better this year although i do suspect they would have gotten flattened by the pacers this year all things equal back to back finals would still be a hell of an accomplishment so much wasted potential it makes me sickwhats the french word for wackythat was years ago thats pretty awesome that you played against lebron in high schooli remember seeing this live and just saying what the fuck how in the god damn fuck could you trade this dudemany dont remember that lakers legend luka lll originally started his nba career in mavsunless its the finalsgive op a slack prolly just got out of prisonim not even a mavs homer but years and itll still be too soon even if flagg turns out to be a beasti might swerve bend that corner woah woaheven more reasonliterally just edited my comment to add that observation before seeing yours lolbut yesjust awesome the best passes of this sort are when your teammates are also befuddled other than the guy who actually gets the passyup thats the oneyeah lol the midseason trade really got the timeline screwed for some people you can see cp right therelively stock peaked so soonidk man they couldve won it all this year and been contenders for a while i think they couldve smoked the pacers if they let luka take his time to get healthy grimes marshall and gafford off the bench is so crazy when you think about it in hindsightreally luka always felt like a dude who wants to be a franchise legend like kobe or dirk disappointingdamn this wizardshornet beef really seriousi meant that it makes no sense to jerk off for a player who doesnt play for yougonna be crazy when they have a warriors rockets esque rivalry in acting like you arent a poverty franchise atm as well is hilariousim a bigger fan of basketball than

good will and reminding us hes truly him and hopefully once hes done we can all remeber him balling outkyrie is the worstill never forget that interview where kyrie said that hes very smart he then spent years proving to everyone that hes dumbi take accountability for having an excuse for my behavior that justifies my actionsthe proper interviewer for kyrie irving would be stephon marburyit would go on for hours marbury would have to warm up by shoving some vaseline on the mic and down his throatkyrie hey i cant admit i was the issue but yaits still batshit that kyrie harden and durant only played games together and went huge whatif had they been healthy weve never seen a greater offensive trio they should have steamrolled they took the eventual champion bucks to games but they basically didnt have that trio together for any of those gamessounds like sean marks mistakei mean we all kinda knew kyrie and the coaching staff didnt see eye to eye but my thing is who or what did t you want nash is a former player whos won mvpsthis guy needs to recover quickly so he can drop this mic he needs to stop answering questions no one asked himnba reddit really leaning into boring kyrie stuff lately someone please start shitposting asapdamn kyrie im not sure who this helps kyrie is just warming up for what hes going to do to the mavs this season he hasnt been toxic in awhile so hes duei swear theres been a few cycles now where kyries quiet for awhile and everyone starts liking him and then he starts talking again and everyone remembers how fucking dumb he is loldurant is trashdo we know who the other coach he is talking about is maybe ty luekyrie drama season stillkyrie with too much time on his hands and this is what you get lol he was doing so well for a while too hahahadamn im trying to forget about this era lolwhat coach would he respectif gilbert arenas wanted people to think he was smart instead of funny would he be kyrie irvingi wasnt ready to walk that walk lol we hear this from him too much wasnt this the same shit he tried to say about dipping for bos after acting like a baby towards lebron in cle then proceeded to complain about how hard it is to be asked to lead a team in bosnot only is he stupid hes also an asshole and he keeps proving ithahaha really brothe unsung or at least way less talked about part of this team era of champions is that coachable players are winning titlesreservesno way this guy is inserting himself in their convo like this kyrie got a webcam and the old crazy shit came back videos and he already contradicted himselffirst if you like steve i love steveand then this whole thing about he didnt really liking steve dude are you okthese comments are what made me wary back theni dont really see us having a head coach irving said on durants new podcast the etcs kd could be a head coach i could be a head coach some daysdurant followed up by agreeing with irving calling it a collaborative effort and naming assistant and former interim head coach jacque vaughn as someone who could fill the role any given dayi want somebody thats gonna understand that i am a human being first i serve my community first and then basketball is something i do every day because i love irving said we always heard and saw how great nash was as a player but also when you get to know him as a person you understand why he can coexist with us we dont need someone to come in with their coaching philosophy and change everything were doingkyrie said years ago when nash was the head coach that he feels the team doesnt have a head coach and that some days ill be the head coach or kd will be the head coach this guy and kd too btw he was saying similar things and specifically agreed with this statement from kyrie never gave nash a chance to coach and never had the mindset of buying in and was saying shit like we dont need a head coach cuz i can run the team to the media before nash ever coached a gamesource feel like out of kd kyrie and harden only harden will have the balls to say it straight on what exactly happened kyries drama it wont happen while hes still in the league thoughhad his own reserves man kyries a dope thank god he can hoopoh no kyrie has a documentary coming outkyrie talking a lot more nonsense than usualcountdown to i was abducted by aliensand i liked ithe had reserves whathe is a nut job head casekylie really the stereotypical dude that thinks hes an actual genius but is really an absolute moronmoroncall me when u get mvp kythis new mavs culture is something else man kyrie going allin on the nicoadelson traindallas fans thought they could change himalthough i will say it hasnt spilled onto the courtyeteasythey needed a puppet they can control and didi see nothing wrong with what he is saying even took some accountability people just love to shit on him for some reasonis kyrie dropping a tell all book i swear every few hours there is another sound bite of himam i crazy or wasnt this quote about coaching himbeing coached by him said before wasnt this knownrape apologist anti vaxxer antisemite flat earther and i missing anythingi dont really get the kyrie hate flat earth stuff weird anti vaxx is just odd from the perspective of just being a healthy person the liberation mindset he talks about for palestine sudan congo haiti thats the best version of him idk i feel like you all see clips of incoherence and dont name the effort to actually get to the bottom of what hes trying to convey which admittedly is hard to follow hes more than these one off clips where the only point he makes is how much him and steve didnt really gel together and clowning on the words he uses what are we in grade school you clearly understood the point its just pedantici would love if this sub just stopped allowing drama and stream clip bullshit just let there be a nbatmz sub and stop spamming this subreddit with the dumbest shit possiblethese comments are digusting he doesnt throw anyone under the bus because he knows its more complex than just blaming one person or even himself even kd and nash know that if you watch the whole video of kyrie explaining it its obviousdeletedreading the comments i can tell yall some pathetic no pussy getting white boys smhyall are slick racist bro all he said was steve nash wasnt a good coach while dealing with personal problems since when was it funny to talk about mens mental health issuesim convinced here was a point late in his cavs tenure when kyrie started worrying about sounding intelligent to others since then he talks in a lot of word salads like he does herei see kyrie has flushed some of his goodwill down the toilet for a good couple years where irving was mostly quiet in the media the narrative was slowly shifted to make the nets debacle durants fault since he wasnt enough of a leader to get a grown yr old guard on a max contract to take a vaccine and play more than half the gamesall these streams show is how out of touch kyrie was that team wouldve won a minimum of championship if he wouldve agreed to get vaccinated hell they almost beat the champs with games of kyrie and a hobbled harden yes the nyc mandate rules were stupid he could watch but not play and away players who werent vaccinated could play and the mayor lifted them as soon as baseball started because half the yankees team wasnt vaxxed but he still ruined the team harden became disgruntled as a result of one of the players being a part timer notice how durant and harden still interact in the media kyrie and harden do notand incorrectly at that they had reservations not reservesjust a reminder that kyrie doesnt know jack about shit he just cosplays intellectuali watched most of this stream and watched this entire section it was crazy he kept describing the situation in a tone that absolved him of being the issue while describing things where he was clearly the issue the entire time hed pair it with a bunch of yeah i wasnt perfect but neither was anyone else therejust a stunning lack of self awareness imagine the angles hes not telling us if this is the info hes willingly divulging to people because he doesnt think he sounds terriblehe hasnt changed at all he just stopped talking until he got paid againless is moretheres a quote by einstein saying that geniuses makes complex things sound simple opposite of it is a person that makes things sound complex but when is not in other words things can be explained simple but some people just want to sound intelligent or simply bullshittingi think hes making it pretty clear he actively didnt want nash durant did and the team went with durants choice surprise surprise kyrie didnt get along with the coach he didnt wantlisten kyrie i am not going to deal with your flat earth bullshit and i saw you burning sage on the court yesterday before practice you burnt two of the panels at the top of the key do you have any idea how much that shit costs to fix alright now where are we at with your vaccinationi legitimately think its because nash is white would be par for the course for kyrieok what reserves did you have about nash as coach kyrie cause he was white or because you didnt want to be coached by anyone at allabsolute cinema mavs are carrying the drama department big time the past year thank you for your service he got his extension and immediately went back into conspiracy kyrie and this time on what seems like a never ending streamit legit sounds like hes blaming kd on that kd coming back from achilles and needed to find himself again but he was ready to go my dude you were literally missing for a stretch that seasonget this guy in a room with kanyeit took him a year longer than i thought to pop off but im glad were here now lmaocouldve been cool streamer kyriethis is how people talk when theyre guiltythats his whole thing he never actually says anything hes just jordan peterson with a handlethe ryen russillo specialthe dude was really made to be a streamer just so happens that hes also made for being very good at basketball as well lolhe and jaylen brown just say a whole lotta nothing but have convinced you theyre smart theyre dumb as fucking brickswas he responding to questions from his chatits when stupid people are trying to sound deep and smartfor example everything kyrie has ever saidwere in new york city the media capital of the world and you just got to walk a little different and i wasnt ready to walk that walki think that sums it up pretty well he knew he was standing out based on his views but he didnt care to change even if it affected the rest of the team negativelyi feel its pretty simple he said he didnt like nash became the head coach while admitted he didnt handle brooklyn well from his personal thingsnot kyrie lolhe need to be careful because nico always can trade him for lebron lolthe luka trade fixed his broke brain so now hes back to normal againi thought he tore a knee ligament and not a part of his brainthe more you hear from kyrie and kd the more you cant help but feel a little bad for harden into being baited into working with them its literally like if your friend invites you to a party or event with their other friends and you decide to go only to find out that the other friend group is pretty problematic and your one friend there keeps enabling them this sub is always shocked when players speak their mind outside of the guidance of their pr guyshes streamingi thought at first he was talking about a wine cellar or somethingi had my own reserves must be said with a posh accentthe guy thinks he is one of the most profound individuals in the world and thinks he articulates his thoughts well just what happens i guess when you think youre able to see beyond what everyone else can seei feel like kyrie is walking the same path kanye didhes also a textbook example of being dumbliterally textbook lacking so much knowledge in so many things that he simply cannot grasp how much knowledge he lacks its painful too combine that with how good he is at basketball and its a tough combobc you dont agree with him hes a shit personi can promise you only white people think kyrie is a shit person its crazy how povs can be differentwe do thanksi dont know i have my reserves that hes a smart guymulti year contracted kyriehe was playing good quiet soldier while tryna get that new multi year deal the moment he signed it hes off his rocker againto be fair hes been like this since he left cleveland gilbert arena said it best about this situation lebron teach his teammate how to move a lot of mofucker dont like that thats why their character reach the surface the moment they leftconsidering that this is a valid crashoutdidnt even get a chance to defend the conference titlejust reunite him thencmon bron come hereits from the same previous streami hear three things wanted a successful experienced coach acknowledged he had a career year and the team was great under nash acknowledged loosely he emotionally and physically was not preparedbrooklyn shouldnt have split up the team they still had a chance at a title that seasonkd steph and klayyeah nash had no chancedoes he even have your number savedcooper flagg is gonna play a lot of minutes its not like kyrie and ad had a thing for more than one but kyrie has already shown just because you have a team stacked with talent that he wont absolutely fuck it upits not that serioustheyre botsi dont think he said nash wasnt a good coach he just wanted a coach that had championship experience moresoathletes who are coasted through school because of their athletic potential now doesnt want to sound like a dumb jock stereotype he sounds exactly like aaron rodgerstbh i still think to this day the reason kyrie left the cavs and became what he is today is because that guy said is lebron your father figure to this day kyrie is still bothered by that comment it literally was a franchise altering moment by someone not even in the franchise thats right up there with we talking about practice and if embiid demanded a trade after being suspended for gently assaulting a reporter for commenting on his dead brother and son in the same article in the most disrespectful wayhes into hotep shit so im betting his ego is gigantic to want to sound intelligentthe taking not taking wasnt even the dumbest part for me it was his whole voice for voiceless bsthe same voiceless he ditched in a nanosecond when the pro athletes performer exemption came in that allowed him to play againexactly he reminds me of a kid who blames everyone for what he does and never takes any responsibility fori think i remember a story where kyrie was trying to spread sage around the locker room and give speeches and harden was basically like lol wtf is thiskyrie has to stay relevant hes hurt how else is he gonna remain the center of attention this guys post career could be deion level fascinating one dayyeah no the yankees were one of the most vaxxed teams in baseball nothing was lifted for themabsolutely nothing stupid about vaccine mandatesthe mandate wasnt stupid all he had to do was get the shot we mandate vaccines for all sorts of things like public school attendance who even cares if mandate policy is flawed just get the shot and its over if you join the military in the us you are getting vaccines whether you like it or not kyrie and the others who cry about the covid vaccine which seems to extend to all vaccines are children literally afraid of something for no actual reason they can point to it still makes me mad how much we cater to absolute ignorancenow now it has been proven that age has nothing to do with complying to the law you can be yr and still antivaxcant force the clotshot kyrie made the right medical decisionsorry kyrie didnt want to inject a rushed vaccine into his body so your favorite team might win a title weirdosthe nyc mandate rules were not stupid so many people died during the pandemic that medical examiners had to start getting freezer trucks outside their offices to store all the excess bodies icus were overwhelmed and almost always didnt have beds for months it was a terrible time and kyrie is a terrible personwell turns out he was right about the vaccineyour not in their position you dont know the conversation had behind closed doors kyrie is human first if he believes he doesnt want vaccination why is he taking one for fans if he died tomorrow we not taking care of his family god first everything else after basketball is a game religion and belief come first s you cant go on the court while others who are also uin canada theyre called reservessteve nash ran psyopjokes of courseevery single thing is not going to go your way at work and if it doesnt it doesnt give you the right to blow that up for everyone else he had a chance to respond a different way and he went nuclear kyrie lacks maturity and perspective dude iswas mad blessed to pull this kind of stunt rich people create their own problems when theyre bored loltheres something called disagree but commit in the workplaceyou will not have everything your way but you still need to be a teamplayer when it comes to ityou can totally get along with someone who isnt your ideal or first choice as a boss or colleague in fact if youre not a child about it you can even get along professionally with someone you strongly dislikeand the other day he said that kenny didnt like him which was another coach he didnt wantpar for course but yesad gonna force a trade with kyries drama and shit hahahahahakyrie took that extension so he can focus on knee rehab and off court shenanigans love iti was actually scared for a second he would just work out fine in dallas him lasting two full season without showing who he really is should be put on his resumehe is physically and mentally incapable of taking accountability he will pass it off to as many different people as possible this entire time talking about brooklyn the only thing hes admitted to is being immature and so far has put a lot of blame onto othersits also how people talk when theyre just fucking stupidkd literally made the most vague nonstatement possibleprobably because he didnt want to call out kyrie and then kyrie is basically like yeah see im not talking this personally it totally wasnt about me so im not taking this personally because yeah i fucked up pretty goodbut it wasnt my fault but im not taking this personally because we all had a lot going on and i know hes not talking about me so im not taking this personally like brother he left it vague for a reason just dont comment lmaothats how stupid people talk when they want to fake being smartreminds me of those college assignments with word count requirements lolwhat do you mean by he what do you mean by never what do you mean by actually what do you mean by says what do you mean by anythingwho is the jd vance of the nbafucking a fake doll of your ex wife is kind of like fucking a couch but i assume there are more contenderslol stealing this for the futurelmfaoat first i read that as jordan peele and i was offended because peele is fucking awesomehe zagged on coherenceyeah but kyrie irving could never have made such legendary contributions to the good will hunting live episode of the rewatchablesare we sure kyrie is coherentexplain reference plzman i still remember when brown was praised as one of the intelligent and thoughtful dudes in the league funny how that turned outyea thats what i got pretty clear imobro if nico could do that kyrie wouldnt have ever suited up lolim not shocked at all hes been like thisyea wow man kyrie so profound wow magnets how do they work see so far earth flat wownah he just misspoke he was trying to say i had my own preserves like delicious jams and jelliesahhhhhhhhh the frenchnever taking responsibilities for ones own actions makes you a coward and a poor excuse of a person adults who constantly act that way are shit peopletheres certain things that automatically make you a shit person no matter whether you agree with someone or not bigotry is one of themnah man its the bigotryno but ironically if you do agree with him you probably are a pretty shitty person lolor the antisemitism he spreads racism aside hes still a fucking moron who thinks the earth is flati know this is crazy to say but i think supporting hitler quotesantisemitism and spreading conspiracies like flat earth stuff does make you a shit person pretty hot take i know nah but for real anyone who thinks kyrie isnt a shit person just means that they dont give a fuck about certain people and before someone says but kyrie does so much activism there are plenty of athletes who do social justice work to uplift communities without actively harming others kyrie is not a person you should die on a hill for if you do youre just showing your assso youre just going up and down this thread trying to defend an antisemitic narcissistic flatearther and antivaxxerby claiming people are being racistyou actually that dumb or just enjoy acting like scumamazing thats simultaneously a maximum dumbass take and racist congratswhat a weird thing to say lolthats racistouch this is some naive shit are speaking for all black people and all white people in one sentence impressively ignoranti can promise you too that as non white people and not dumb american flat earther nonsense think kyrie irving have a lot of shitty and dumb opinion outside of basketballkyrie is one of the only nba athletes who is serious about advocacy work and promoting social justice in black and indigenous communities hes also been a consistent supporter of the wnba hes got some dumbass takes but i still support himis the word he was looking for reservationsby that logic doncic should teach that too since kyrie was tame and kinda got his reputation back when they were togetheryeah nobody really listening they both had reservations with each other when he just started to coach because he wanted a cosch who has experienced winning and he wanted to win that year he had but kd just returned from injury and the other point is what kd meant by other shit kyrie acknowledged where he was dealing with the whole situation with familycovid and wasnt dealing with it well then thats why he doesnt take it personally when kd said that cause he gets it that he was part of the shit and couldve dealt with it better people not really listening they just wanna shit on him like they already have biases im not even a kyrie fan like i hated his whole covid sagahonestly james was over the bullshit he saw what was going on and leftexactly they should have just gone for it if james leaves for nothing then so be it but the ers wouldnt have been able to sign him without some sort of trade occurring so imo that ben simmons trade would have still been available in the off season could have even expanded the trade and hopefully not end up with a useless simmons a trade might not even have been necessary because the mandate got lifted and the big could have got a ring that year ill never understand harden choosing embiid over durant even with kyrie bullshit those two could have won togethertell that to the reddit botsin the end its not only the school books documentaries common sense specialized podcasts eg history can help you it doesnt have to be formal education only but if you think youre the smartest guy in the world no education will help to cover for thatwhats hotepthat is exactly what he isi have a feeling were gonna see a lot of dumb kyrie podcast clips when hes retiredis he the aaron rodgers of basketball chip generally underachieving given how talented his teams have been and how talented he is antivax constantly saying crazy things to try and stay relevantjudge was not vaxxed very big story at the timevaccines arent stupid trying to keep people safe isnt stupidhaving a mandate that means you cant go on the court while others who are also unvaccinated can kinda stupidthis one was stupid though he was in the same building right beside everyone other players were allowed to not be vaccinated and play but he couldnt thats stupid either let him play or dont let anyone unvaccinated playi agree vaccines are good but it is absolutely stupid policy to be able to sit in the crowd but not play probably endangering more people in the crowd tbhit is stupid how come if your unvaccinated you can watch but not play it should all or nonflair up pussyedit replied to the wrong commenttheyre referring to the obvious contradictions to the nyc mandates away players can play but home players cantimagine still thinking this in they instituted the mandates when the consensus was that herd immunity was an achievable goal that vaccinated people did not spread the virus it became obvious pretty quickly that these assumptions were wildly incorrect yet governments never really responded to the new information that happened countless times throughout covidedit lmao all the downvotes exactly people explaining how im wrongexcept for now we have this nyc mandate rules were stupid as per the rules stated above by multiple peopleirrelevant response covid bad yeah who knew visiting players who didnt hail from nyc could play unvaxxed but kyrie couldntkyrie could sit in the stands and watch but not playno the fuck he wasntremovednever said it gave him the right to blow it up just that i think hes actually being pretty clear herekyrie i dont want xteam does xkyrie im unhappy with xwhether its justified or not its pretty simple and clear lolas i said to the other guy i never justified his actions whether you like them or not the point remains that hes being pretty clearim committed to swipe to text on my phone which means ive accepted typos are going to get melots of dnps in the mavs futurecould be bothor when theyre refusing to take those meds because they dont need them i feel like kyrie has a manic thing that leads to these runs of posting things that dont come out the way he thinks they willi dont want to be that guy diagnosing people through a screen but i hope he has people with his best interests at hearthe went to duke lol that is the perfect example of how he talkschubby face terrible opinions about money a criminal and even fans of his team kinda hate him antoine walker is the jd vance of the nbanow grantedpizzad when he should have french fried on the slopes of wisdomnah you misunderstood he was trying to say i had my own preservatives like magnums and trojansnah he was probably trying to build his own army with extremely stupid but overconfident reserves of basketball playersyour choosing to completely ignore all the good things hes done and how no one whos actually interacted with the man has anything bad to say about him instead you focus on his personal beliefs that have little to no effect on the general publicremovedremovedironically if we knew everything youve ever done or said most ppl could find valid reason to call you a shitty person too its funny how ppl who cant stand kyrie always find their way to content involving him lol if your looking for shit to complain about you can find some in anyone you meet or knowthe man reposted a video once like years ago took it down and stated publicly that hes not anti jewish and youre still pushing that narrativeyall are so dramatic lol kyrie has done nothing to harm anyone your just making shit up to push your personal agenda bc you dont like the guyyea he is tripping i do think its true he has a higher popularity rating among our people but i definitely wouldnt say only white people think hes terrible heck im black and i dont care for a lot of the things hes said and donenever said anything about racism lol stop that shit mani said that only white people look at kyrie as a shitty person its a white persons pov to say hes a shit person when hes notlook at your response lol one of the reasons you say hes a shit person is because of his opinion on the earth being flat is stupid isnt racistlol im racist for noticing that only white people hate kyrie thats why i say its a white persons pov to say hes a shit person out of all the nba peoples whos actually shit people who beat woman etc its pretty wild that kyrie has gotten that labelthen he left phillymy guy this is not a rabbit hole you want to go downits just insane shit like actually insaneblack radicals in the simplest termsmaybe hell make up a new version of math like terrance howardnaw kyrie is gonna run for congress or some shit with his inflated ego then lose hilarious fashion because all his antisemitism antivax and flat earth stuff will come up on top of being a condescending to everyone around him while being wrong about everythinghe did do antisemitism first he caught that one early not like nebuchadnezzar early butnah rodgers for all his nosense has mvps kyrie is really just a rich mans stephon marburynowhere near as talented as rodgersit was speculated but he has no issues getting into canadayes he was canada required all entrants into the country to be vaccinated in the yankees played at toronto a month into the season and every single yankees player including judge played in toronto the red sox had multiple players denied entry into canada due to their vaccine status and had to play without themamazing there are still people shilling for the covid vaxnyc politics is overflowing with shit like this where the underlying motivation for something is good and decent and necessary but for whatever reason the political leadership of the city has to monstrously fuck it up anyways as if they have an inescapable psychological compulsion to be massive pieces of shitnice logic there i guess according to you the vaccine doesnt work since those in the crowd took itcorrect it should be allnot only this but if you were unvaccinated on a nonny team you could play nonsensicalthis is like a child pointing at another kid crying its not fair you guys cant be for realteam fauci brotherthat was because they legally couldnt mandate the away players to be vaccinated iirc some interstate commerce bsand just because it saved less lives than initially estimated doesnt mean it wasnt worth it according to that data the vaccines still saved million lives that is still a massive amount of livesyoure a soulless monster with the reasoning ability of a wet paper baglmao the problem is that it wasnt im unhappy with x it was im unhappy with x and will use any excuse to make things difficult for everyone until they change xeven before the vaccine nonsense there was him ditching at times like when he said it was for his sisters birthday only it was like a week or twoyep not sure why people cant understand what hes saying its seems pretty clear to meespecially when x is hire a coach with absolutely no experience coachingthe court finds the defendant kyrie irving guilty of stupidhow does antoine walker feel about couchesflawless referenceno he was trying to say that he owns several large areas of land where wild game animals are hunted for sporti think youre thinking prophylactics or protection preservatives are the shit that make food last longeryoureignorant troll responsewhat kinda dismissive bullshit is that lmaowell youre white so i dont care what your view isfoh you damn silly goose grow updoesnt apply to meare you suggesting its only a white person thing to dislike bigotsedit why did you delete your comment calling the above comment a white person povexcept you dont have to dig to find out kyrie is a shitty person he puts it out there himself very publicly on a pretty regular basisyou act like i was out looking for videos of kyrie being a dumbass as if it hasnt been all over this sub for the past week you didnt but youre painting with a very wide brush assuming anyone other than white people have a problem with kyries antisemitismplenty of people that arent caucasian fucking hate the idiot for the misinformation he pushed or the bullshit he pulled during his stint on their teamyoure being fully ignorant spewing this shit kinda exactly like kyrie bloviate somewhere elseim not white and i can confirm he is a shitty personim japanese and i think hes a shit person lolyou mean his outright rejection of scientific fact due to his incessant need to sound smarthe doesnt know how to use the word reservations after promoting his own indigenous heritagehes a moron and youre also a moronthats like the least bad example and it still proves hes a shit person when you have a platform and kids listen to you and you go around telling them to reject science and well established evidence you are a shitty personhundo p bud thats about as valid as saying only black people think the earth is flat ur getting shit on but ur not wrong players like bron have a massive influence but stand for literally nothing and has essentially supported a genocide promoting the book was obviously ridiculous but hes the only player ive seen actually do anything real lolthen lose hilarious fashion because all his antisemitism antivax and flat earth stuff will come up on top of being a condescending to everyone around him while being wrong about everythingso he is definitely winning the red statesgreatest bag lollemme tell you i was watching the world cup finals between usa vs serbia in madrid courtside dream come true to watch the best of the best do their thing except no lebron and i was very bummed kyrie was by far the dude that impressed me the most he stood out with those dribbles and handles i was genuinely speechless with kyrie would you say that if america made an american football team that ar would be a dude that would stand out amongst the very best on their same team genuine questioncanada and the us both required vaccination to cross the borderdude even americas enemies were telling all their citizens to get vaccinated literally every country that saw low mortality were countries that got people masked social distanced and vaccinated as quickly as they couldthere is a literal mountain of research papers on the effectiveness of the vaccineand maybe a million fewer people would have died if our moron of a president didnt embolden unthinking uneducated people who decry any and all vaccines right up until the death and suffering hits their familyjohns hopkins has this nice reference for the nearly studies done worldwide ignorance on full displayi mean youre the bad guyi forget when is everyone going to drop dead from itwell why didnt you use your expertise to stop it from happening dr reddityoure on reddit some people here still wont leave the house without a maski think this is closer to the truth as to how everything was handled vaccine mandates are not stupid but there were a lot of exceptions and variations to what you could and could not do that simply made little or no rational sensebut kyrie instead of looking for ways to figure out how he could get on the court while satisfying the mandate was doing the complete oppositeway too much dramathe other book recommendation is the equivalent of what kyrie thinks is research its pseudohistory there is no place for us by brian goldstone is actual research within the scope of the relevant historiographyread klein and thompsons book abundance that kind of thinking is the main topicdont see how it protects against covid if he can still come to the games just dont let anyone unvaccinated come to the gamesworst analogy of all time lolyoure a dummythe vaccine saved lives yeah but also caused some bad side effects for people who didnt need it the mandates and some other covid protocols were insane in hindsightyou sound reasonable and smartimagine thinking a state mandating someone get something injected into their body to go to work and make money is a good thing thats legitimately some fascist thinkinglike the steve that nash had been working with before he was hired by the nets steve kerrnash was a skills coach for the warriors and other teams and would work with them at least once a monththats how durant got to know nashlive audience determines man that struggles with elementary school science is actually dumboh ummm a lot of languages mine included call condoms preservativeslol its the truth a few comments up they suggested it was white people pov to take accountability and own your mistakessome could say you all are bigots for your opinions on kyrieremovedbeing a flat earther doesnt make you a shit person just an ignorant person i would argue calling people morons on the internet makes you a shittier person than a flat earther this holierthanthou attitude from you while resorting to ad hominem attacks is hilariousbut what is true is this its only white people saying kyrie is a shitty personthats not true i dont think the earth is flatlol thank you bro at least i see somebody gets iti really got down votes im getting shitted on fasho yeah rodgers is a time mvprodgers is in the conversation of greatest qb of all time kyrie is nowhere near the conversation of greatest basketball playeryou dont even have to look at other countries look at what the rich were doing here they were jumping lines going to poorer areas where doses were availableits not about having the choice to take it its about telling people how effective it was then taking peoples jobs away for complying hope that helpsok lets discuss show me how im ignorant on a vaccine that was rushed out in record time with promises that not only could you not catch covid but you couldnt spread it either explain to me how shutting the world down made more sense than a shelter in place for people with comorbidities while the young and healthy kept the economy rolling please educate me wise liberal redditordo you really think that kind of response is going to change anyones mindim the bad guy is this the brain dead reddit mind at workwhen are the unvaccinated supposed to die pandemic of the unvaccinated lmaoooedit the dude below replies and then blocks classic reddit tough guythis doesnt even resemble an intelligent sentient thought good luck in middle school next semesterand thats fine but how dare kyrie choose to sit out rather than inject something into his bodyremovedi will not fill my brain with that repackaged neoliberal slop ezra klein is an ignorant hack who wouldnt recognize humanity if it was shoved down his throat all the way back out his asscovid vaccine side effects are extremely rare and nowhere close to the scale of lives saved every medical treatment or procedure carries some risk of side effects or rare adverse reactions if avoiding any possible side effects is your standard youd have to reject nearly all modern medicinemy b ive never heard that beforetaking responsibility for your actions is a white people thinglol theyre trying so hard to make this about raceno its white people pov to say kyrie is a shitty person for having opinions when he has done nothing but great things in the community and his communitythats the beauty of free speech people can say whatever they want and were free to call you a dumbass for believing thatliterally all of you nah you just enjoy stanning a shitty narcissist so you feel emboldened to act the same kind of fool in your own lifehe spread antivaxxer bullshit during a global pandemic that killed thousands that makes him an assholehe proudly spread antisemitic hate to his young fans that makes him an assholehes a grown man that refuses to accept any responsibility for his own shortcomings on or off the courtfor all these legitimate well documented reasons he sucks youve got shit tasteits not youre just baiting similarly to kyrie you come up with a biased opinion and consider it factwait youre blackto be fair in the nfl mvp just means you were the best qb that season not as hard as winning it in basketballgreatest qb of all time is as much of a conversation as greatest hockey player of all time you get some moron homers who hold out but theres clearly a guy who is the greatest of all timebringing up rodgers is like bringing up orryea thats a fair statement but not really what i was saying curry is all time better than kyrie and i was drooling over kyrie everyone was not just me forget what they won for a second if the best players from the generation are on the same team is rodgers the dude that stands out im having a hard time seeing it honestly other than lebron the best players on planet earth were kyries team mates and he was outshining them on the court not dropping not out there winning ball games by himself just flat out the funnest dude to watch on that basketball court side by side with the best on the planet i feel like i can put a few dudes just in qb position that could be funner to watch not taking anything away from ar just how i feel after watching these dudes play meter from my faceit absolutely does notyep it tells me you or somebody you know was foolish got in trouble for it and now youre holding a ridiculous grudgeagainst something that has a mountain of proof showing it saved livesits like having a grudge against cprno one ever promised that you could not catch covid and no one ever promised that you couldnt spread it either so theres nothing to discuss with you because youre living in a world of delusionif you thought a vaccine meant you iterally cant catch or spread a disease thats on you for being too dumb to understand how vaccines and mitigation workrushed out lol they had been working on that vaccine since the sars outbreakthis was published precovid so not biased by whatever information warfare was going on during that time exactly do you think the young and healthy go at the end of the business day theres a reason schools were shutdown and its because kids spread viruses to each other and go home to spread those same viruses thereprofound ignorance and unrivaled stupidityim sick of pretending its normal peoples job to convince dumb fucks of facts they could read themselves if they had a functioning braindo you really think this guy is gonna change his mind about vaccine being badnothing will change the minds of peabrains stop accepting their stupidity as legitimate youre normalizing itfuck no but its annoying having to see it everywhere and sometimes its nice to just lash out at people like thatis coddling and encouragement going to change these peoples minds theyre just as rooted in ignorance as you arecrying about libs while pretending someone else is in a hive mind god i hope you dummies never become self aware lolyoure out here acting like a victim screeching about libs in your comment history people like you are exhausting and selfish and boiled down simply youre the problemmillions of them didedit user above was blocked for weirdly dming me after i replied not interested in a private chatyou know what would look like an intelligent thoughtsentient is redundant since intelligent already covers what sentient meansdoing actual research into the hundreds of studies on the effectiveness of the vaccinesthen youd know whether youd put peoples lives at risk by not getting vaccinatedhint you did luck ever getting a woman to touch youvaccines were tested and effective some of the restrictions were dumb these are the factsthere it is science deniers cant help but tell on themselves fucking brain deadmasks are def more effective but i will say the shot was never going to give coverage but it did slow it down enough to keep it containedwhat are some examples of bad things ezra has done im only vaguely aware of himthats true but the risks of the covid vaccine were massively understated which makes sense when you consider how it was developed quickly with little testing another issue was that it did and still does almost nothing to stop the spread of coviddudes a weirdo for sureand its dumbass pov to act like kyrie is some innocent angels whos never done or said anything wrong lol oh the super rich dude gives back to his community while talking out of the side of his mouth against other people in his community guess what dude that makes you an asshole not a saintnever said he was the greatest brady has settled that debate but rodgers is in the conversationfederer in his prime was incredible to watch he was doing so many things no one else could dosomething tells me youre an employee and not a business owner dont bother replying because i know the answerhes a parrot just give him a cracker and move onyou are a liaredit downvoted by blueanon cult members this is why she lost btw if you thought an experimental vaccine was okay to be practically mandatory to live youre substantially more ignorant than mehow fortunate it was magically ready to launch months after covid leaked out from a lab in chinai couldnt imagine being this delusionalhey genius instead of closing the global economy down sending checks to everyone they could have paid hotels to house those with documented comorbidities so they could be protected while keeping the healthy working would have been much easier but that wouldnt have allowed the further redistribution of wealth to the top percent profound ignorance is correct youre a doltyoure on reddit the biggest liberal hive mind experiment in historyyoure calling people the bad guy like a cartoon character dork you dont have any facts so youre name calling just sit down youre intellectually inferiorhow many vaccines are safely tested in less than monthslike it or not the vaccines were rushed and we are lucky that didnt bite anyone in the assthe second half of your sentence suggests a fundamental misunderstanding of how vaccines and herd immunity work if the vaccine had uptake or as close to it as reasonably possible its quite possible that things never get as bad as they gotnot op but klein just argues in bad faith a lot imo regarding abundance though i lean more to the left but i really dont think the book is that bad most of the good ideas in there are things that i think would legit be praised if it was written by someone who was outwardly more leftistthe vaccine should have been a choice and a highly recommended one for those with comorbidities for of the population covid is a mild cold that lasts for a weeksomething tells me youve got the depth of a quarkflair up pussythe difference between scientists and million dollars and scientists and billion dollarsgo back to your hole with the rest of the people who dont get enough attentionits almost like they made it a top priority and expedited ityoure on reddit too guess you must be a liberalweird how theres just so many liberal hating liberals on redditwhy if i didnt know any better id say both sides are on reddit and youre ignoring that to suit your shtickshut up baby dickmrna vaccines have been in development for decades flut shotbut regardless the reason why they could move through the development cycle for this particular vaccine so quickly isnt because they cut corners on trials it is because they had all the resources in the world on the admin side straight to the front of the line for reviews steps could be done in parallel rather than in series etcaccording to cdc vaccine development often takes yearsof laboratory researchoh yeah one million percent agree just was thinking in terms of individual effectiveness instead of herd effectiveness they absolutely work as intended just giving that person benefit of the doubt i think theyre dumbjust put the fries in the bag thanksyes and the clinical trials were able to be completed in checks notes record time because there were more scientists and money thats not how that worksyoure the one commenting to me you silly idiotexpedited is another word for rushed outlibertarian so technically yes now go to any random popular sub that has nothing to do with politics and tell me what you see more ofpersonal insults over a vaccine lmao brainwashed droneedit user below blocked me lmao fake tough guyother vaccine mechanisms of action were in development for longer and any new vaccine in those categories doesnt get to jump queue and bulldoze preclinical and stages of clinical trials in a yearonly reason covid did was because it was an emergency and there was nothing concerning showing upi can tell you they cut one corner immediately lmao long term efficacysafety and follow up on phase i am not even disparaging their work it was a miracle but less dishonesty probably leads to less conspiracysome of it is ethical issues finding volunteers funding application scaling up production etc you can also argue that some of discovery etc was already piggy backed off earlier workyou still basically bulldozed from preclinical trials through phases of clinical trials to fda approval to mass production in several times shorter time than just about any other drug or vaccine getsi get that reddit is filled with people of limited critical thinking i have a degree related to thiseven if you do an accelerated trial and for some reason already start at phase you are usually looking at least years if you are doing follow ups for long term safety and efficacycovid for obvious reasons did not go through this long term prospects for the vaccine were basically without trial luckily nothing bad happened and they were safe and boosters helped iron this outit actually isyeah they should have just put it on the back burner after a pandemic broke out im not sure throwing time and resources behind a vaccine during a pandemic is a conspiracydeletedare you not also using personal insults over a vaccine brainwashed drone doesnt seem to be a compliment or is it only cool when you do itedit this person is so salty they dmd me haha and was blocked for said dmbecause we were in a global pandemic so all efforts were put to getting the work done thats what happens when the gov and private sector work together for the benefit of everyone term efficacy and safety are kind of the central points to phase clinical trials no all publicly available information explicitly states that no steps were skipped during clinical trials just that these teams were provided extreme priority and had as many resources as they neededfollow up on phase also wasnt skipped but happens after fda approval and distribution of the drug phase these drugs are still being monitored and reviewed and there is lots of information that is publicly available on the subject when theres a large part of the population that thinks covid was just a plot to control peopleis that right what was the plot baseless conspiracies about the vaccine were inevitablelong term prospects for the vaccine were basically without trial luckily nothing bad happenedim just a moron but doesnt this contradict nothing bad happening sure we are only years removed but how do we know nothing bad can come from itlong term effects studied quickly sounds really intelligentstudying the potential long term effects of a vaccine is now considered being put on the back burner lolno im not a fan of any big government anything thus not a fan of businesses being shut down and citizens needing paperwork to freely travel the country during covidalways a possibility i guess but no real indication so farthey did thaton the one hand everyone thinks youre a moron but on the other hand you are clearly a moron',\n",

to him and posted it no shade but that is corny to melist of transitive properties on display here the picture is corny tatums photoshoot and wearing the same celtics practice jersey as kobe was also corny the good news though is that kobe was also corny in his younger years his teammates used to mock him for being corny and cosplaying as michael jordancorny pic and i couldnt give a f about getting his selfiei wouldnt recognize him at all on the streetits hilarious how many corn balls are in the leagueif he went to practice while injured never posted a pic about it and let others make this comparison hed be seen in a positive lightbut because he is the one who coordinated the photo op he made the comparison and he posted it himself he is seen in a negative lightand then theres his response which tells everyone whats really on his mindwhen asked about whether or not he could be as great as kobe williams responded annnyyything is possssiiibletatum already exists dont need another corny playerhe went out of his way to be a copycat he knows people roasted tatum not sure what he expectedit is cornythen he doesnt even own it he couldve just been like whatever man just showing respectgetting defensive over it makes it sound like it touched a nerve because he knows its corny toobro sports players take this shit too seriously this is such a bad deflection yeah ok you can hoop doesnt mean youre not a cornball goofyhe wrote this clap back from his spam account year old adult man with a spam account on igresponse confirms he is indeed cornyif tatum did this thohes not wrong

celebs learn to laugh at themselves loljdub played with a torn ligament and managed to drop in the finals talk your shit jdubhes so fucking corny he makes tatum look like a choir boycornyid walk right by him an would know who he is tbhhes right but reddit is gonna get worked up about itmocking an nba player for honoring kobe isnt critiqueits projection these guys arent reacting to jalentheyre reacting to their own failure to matter when youve never chased anything real watching someone succeed unapologetically triggers your deepest fear being ordinary calling it cornyis just a weak shield against the reminder that you never even tried just dont copy kobe too much jdub cause then well have to ban you from colorado hotelswhat does couldnt hold my water in real life meanthis is corny thois jdub the new tatumi would have asked him why he didnt put on the shorts toohow does one achieve this postureayookobe would neverdid he do this before or after kobes daughter also recreated this picture because if he did it before then who cares hes just looking up to one of his heroes in a non major moment but if he did it after kobes daughter did it and posted it then hes super fuckin lamehes my favorite current player and he is corny as hellthe kobe photo was corny tooaquarius stocks through the roof rni would never ever score a basket on him this is still cornyjalen thats awesome

these young mfs in the league are corny like tf is this shit confused as to why someone would want to hold his watertheyre not wrong about it being corny and hes not wrong about the selfie thing loltwo things can be true at the same time its unbelievably corny for him to do this but the average joe hasnt accomplished anything comparable to jdubboth things can be true jalentr is this logic whether or not youre corny has fuckall to do with whether or not the people pointing it out can beat you at basketball or anything elsewhogod i hate those fans that try to instigate no point of even asking that questionthis isnt as corny as jayson tatum posting a text to kobe knowing hes dead and posting it on instagram but these guys gotta get their own personalitythis is cornycrazy how this cornball is still only the rd most corny player on the thunder behind auraman and from treball is odee shooting hangpulls who tries to convince people that a white minnesotan had oxtails and greens on

sayyikeskobe in walmart pjs is just so immaculateyall hating with anything you got okc still the champs lolman be original damnwho knew basketball players are morons what an amazing new insighti mean just because someone thinks its corny doesnt mean they hate him and arent a fan of him jfcnormally hate when athletes respond to fans over petty shit but this was kind of funny ngl hope he doesnt make a habit of it thoughi can actually predict some reddit angles on this one this pic is corny but its not tatum level cornycan confidently say this is cringe and i would never ask for a selfie from this guydeletedalmost as corny as jayson tatum doing it prior to winning a ring except tatum had a professional photoshootwhat does corny even mean anymore let the kid be a kid so many people want to clown him but have wanted to imitate someone theyve looked up to in lifestill corny why cant these younger players find their own stylethat dude really is corny af for thatno i wouldnt corn ballok its still cornyjayson tatum prolly the happiest guy today hes been dethrone as the corniest in the nba ive watch basketball my whole life honestly i prolly wouldnt recognize this guy if i seen him walking around irllol most people facetoface with jalen williams would not know who he isits still corny as hell brogen z hoopers amiritepeople just hating anything they see now a days lol so many miserable peopleyou people care way too much about what an athlete does interesting its the same people who will line up during a game to ask for an autograph and photo crazy world we live in lamethis the same guy who brought a purse to the espy he should just come out and say he gayidk but to me jalen seems like a nice guy kinda corny for people to make fun of him imothis is x cornier than anything tatums ever donei have to be honest i stopped following the nba closely a few years ago i dont know that manlike kd w the burner but do you rapedo we like it more when celebrities are media trained and have a calculated image or when they are real and make insecure emotional fools of themselveshe is corny for that nothing wrong with that thoboth can be true here lolguess two things can be truedepends on if there are refs or notwere pressed by people paying homage nowgot it ill add this to my list of immature activities got emwould be corny if he didnt win reggie choke then loose was the corniest things to ever happenjalen williams is a top cornball in the league and i love him for iti mean you all would be asking for a selfie thoughi may not be able to hold his water but at least im not holding a dead guys dick in my mouth and why would i want a selfie with him when i could just go to petsmart and take one with a puglebron essentially said the same thing about his first game in cleveland with the miami heat and people didnt call him corny and insecure for that the reaction here in the comments is weirdthis guy was so stoked when his wrist got injuredit really is the summer of kobejalen more talented and accomplished at this stage of career when comparednba players could never understand how serious this reddit shit ishas he ever saved a keyboard from a mountain dewhot cheetos disaster we are all experts in our own little niches jalendrop the gofundme linkfor the asg they should have a competition to see who can cornily imitate kobe the best tatum and jdub would have the ultimate battlerightly so this is corny they should just be themselves and make their own legacyfactscame here to say hes every bit as corny as tatum for this sorry but youve earned it jdub this is your own faultif anyone texted kobe and said they got him and they losing they would be clownedbc its corny and tatum is the corniest dude in the leagueits weird that they do it but it doesnt really bother me bron was one of kobes closest friends and he doesnt even do shit like this i wonder what the psychology is therei got you today but less cornier versionjalen isnt popular enough to care about lolthats cause tatum texted a dead kobe telling him i got you just to lose well yes because his reputation for corniness is still recovering from him texting a dead man this is jdubs first minor offenceok but also hell nawl cant do disi still clown tatum for texting a dead fucking kobes phonetatum has done this like other timeshes way better at basketball therefore you cant hold his water far superior being than us immune to the corniness of lifei mean yeah were not as rich as famous or as talented but if something is corny we can definitely say its corny if we want toits like if mpj had recreated a tim duncan photo after after winning the finalshey jalen williams can i get a selfie there thats the first time that sentence has ever been utteredim going to start doing this in my regular life tooyeah same people who say that me wearing a full kobe jersey to the ymca dont know half as much as i do about data storage and cloud strategy so theyre just hatersi think its kinda cool deep pull know im on an island there thoughi got you today you cant even hold water brovery corny lolits all dumb haha why is this even a thing why was he even trying to mimic this was that a huge kobe career moment and even after he did it it just seems dumb that its become a thing and yea i guess that means its corny alsoanyone else think this its kinda cool when players do stuff like this make references to past greats or moments in the gameyet he didnt even get the resemblence correctimitation is the greatest form of flattery so imitating someone who you look up too is corny i feel sorry for all you people who didnt have no one to look up too like a father or mentor because if you did you would understand how deep this is yet your hear calling him cornythis is true if someone did it for them sure but if they did it themselves it is kinda cornyeverything is corny to you guys tho yo imitating a hero they watch ever since they were a baby is corny literally everything is cornyhis response was just as corny to be fairi mean he was replying to someone asking him about iti hate how often i see this take its so easy for you to sit there anonymously and say just ignore the hate head but thats not how people think and operate is it not the best strategy for dealing with trolls of course its not but if i got a bunch of losers in my comments calling me corny times a day and someone asked me how i felt about it id tell the honest truth and i respect what he saidyou cant have your cake and eat it if you post anything on social media expect hate and trash talkinghes right thoughsuper corny picture with an insecure reply if you liked the posepic fuck it and expect the trolling no point in replying because you wont come out looking good lolits the corny streisand effecthim responding like that brought attention to this pic which intensified the absolute corninessfunny to act like they wouldntthey settled out of court so it was clearly consensual she better stay tf out colorado lol okc is our number one opp going into thia upcoming seasonyoure getting old brother lighten upthose dumbass commercials where they all show up wearing the same outfit omg corny as shitso its corny to not take yourself seriously when was the last time you laughed and didnt look around first to make sure no one was lookingthe response is actually cringe lmaono its notthis pic is up there if tatum posted this game over lots of celtics fans in here begging for ithow its idiotic when thats the first thing everybody say bout okc they usually just back it up on the court but they champions now they talking shiicorniness aside youre actin like williams isnt an allstar allnba and world champion lol id ask for the picbecause youre a socially awkward reclusei mean tbf its literally one instagram comment in a sea of haters on every post do you think this comment thread dogpiling calling him a corny child or comparing him to private alt account snake kevin durant for comment saying a hater couldnt come close to him is a bit of an overreactionthere was a k like post within an hour of shai having an out of context smirk made after a heckler shit talked him after a finals loss calling him an aura farming corny failure who didnt care about winning or his teamand endless dickriding when tyrese did the chokeidgaf about reddit but such a large sample size consistently hating this much makes me think its not just a reddit echo chamber that post i just mentioned quite literally had more likes then our actual championship win post has gotten in its entirety within an hourcould all just be an echo chamber im taking a shit sorry for the novel lol obviously im biased but ive watched every game and almost every post game interview this season and the post and the way this sub has talked about us at every turn has been the polar opposite of everything ive watchedthis has been some of the most exciting selfless team oriented basketball ive ever seen with true team chemistry yet youd think they all suck and rely on otherworldly ref manipulation to win every game and theyre all tik tok aura farming man children if you didnt watch the games yourselfhe would get called corny too why you trying to make it seem like dub received a positive response we did itttttttttttttttttttttttttthe would probably get made fun of for it even more being corny is his thingas opposed to texting him dressing up like him and trying to recreate other iconic photosif tatum did this several geneva conventions would be brokenon top of that hes not out here flexing on stolen valor the man put up in a crucial finals game with that bum wristya this thread is miserable lmaoyea cuz jdub texted a dead man number and posted itawe im and this is deepyou basically js described this whole sub lmaojalen is taller than the average human and therefore contains a greater amount of water within his body if the average human were to take the amount of water from jalens body they would dieimagine a person that is so beneath you that you wouldnt let them physically hold the arguably most important substance related to your survival on earthtalentless poor peopleusing context hes using the pg version of couldnt hold my jock its actually funny hes trying to be pg because when he switches jock to water it kinda gives a different and nonsensical meaning couldnt hold water means like cant keep a secret or like your argument doesnt hold water which means theres holes in your argument dub is saying none of the commenters are on his level athletically he might even be saying the commenters couldnt even be a water boybasically the people trolling him are losers which is correct and furthermore the people who are trolling the nba player who just won a championship would be asking for a picture irl if they saw him instead of calling him corny so basically they are pussies too lol and hes rightsomehow i think he would get over itit might be as lame as antman being a deadbeat father but idk i guess being corny is more of a crimesend da videoi play this game where i see how long it takes for a wolves nuggets or pacers fan to show up in these subs talking about sga foul baiting ive never seen a post that doesnt have one of you still whining about it the posts will usually have nothing to do with sga or the thunder even but damn you all really cannot focus on anything else and how you going to say any other player is lame when your superstar wont even pay his child supportprobably be better in your eyes if he was getting ig models pregnant then wanting nothing to do with the kid stay salty over that bounced in whipping you tookwhats your pointactually been told okc isnt a draw and doesnt get ratings so hes fine to shit on fans as they dont impact his incomeyoure a guy who posts in nofap and semenretention subreddits and youre insulting other peoplethen its not almost what jayson has done is max corn cosplaying a kobe pic is not the coolest thing but this man did it after putting up in the finals with the injurystop fixating on dick this is the nba sub homie who texted a deceased man number and posted itokno its still corny dude put on pajamas to go shootim goodits a thunder player if this were jokic dancing in china or something it would have k upvotesterminally online kd understands guarantee he is a circlejerk useryou think this is a game cue dmx whats my namei mod foot fetish subreddits for the love of the gamemoderating a subreddit lotta upvotes in this shitlmao this is how pro basketball players sound to me sometimes its like relax man you play a childrens game for a livingwe dont really have any shortage of former athletes struggling with normal life especially if they dont invest well i dont know why they do this shitkd would disagreei mean tatum tore his achillespeople really cant recreate a picture for fun make your own legacythe people overreacting and getting butt hurt over this are the corny onesright this is just short of getting another mans name tatted on you just weird and unoriginal get off kobes nutsno one called kobe corny for wanting to be like mikehe won that game what are you talking abyeah his response was certainly a choice its a corny pic just say you dont care if its corny lol dude is clearly bothered by people calling him out on it and doubled down while trying to sound coolit has we deeeeeeeeeeeeed it jayson tatum vibes lolhey fashionweekyear i enjoy your company see we can make up stuff no ones ever said all day longi got two evians right heregatoradeeeelife is a lot more enjoyable when you stop worrying about being cornydepends on the reference especially because the original was done naturally everything tatum did was lame for exampletheyre only calling it corny cuz they hate kobe tbhnoits cool people so worried about being corny that they straight up never enjoy themselvesits dumbwhat i dislike is the staging vs spontaneity of the resultlike you look at a recreation like this vs like trae shushing the nyc crowd and you can see which one is more belovedeven hali doing the choke was legit because it didnt feel meticulously planned the jdub thing is basically a photo op its like hes trying to force fetch to happen and fetch is not going to happenits not corny this sub just hates kobehe can imitate him on the court maybe wear kobes while he hoops playing dress up is cornyits just corny because dude went out and played halloween dress up lolno matter how you spin this its cornyits corny bruha rapistpersonally i would not associate the word hero with a rapist pedophileits corny and kobe is a pos so yeah he should get shit talk for doing iti cant believe this has so many downvotes this sub truly is filled with teenagers life is better when you do what you want without worrying about being corny theyll grow up one day and realize thishes not obligated to respond to every comment lolyea someone asking him in the comments ignore it and move onyeah and got all salty about it doesnt make him look any betterpart of being a public figure is dealing with stuff like this you start actually acknowledging these kinds of comments all that accomplishes is that you encourage more trolls to comment and youre actively dealing with the negativity instead of just blocking and moving on of course theres always a line where if someone crosses it you should shut them down and publicly shame them but i dont think being called corny qualifiesnah he has to tell the haters how inferior they are its a musti dont see insecurity at all hes not saying it isnt corny hes just saying the people talking shit about it wouldnt say it to his face and probably ask for an autograph lebron said the same thing about his first game in cleveland with the heat i have no problem with thisi wasnt aware of it until this posti wasnt someone who talked shit to him first of all second of all ive never asked anyone for an autograph and wouldnt start with this dude lolnah its still those damn timberwolvestheyre not corny because the laugh when nobody is looking theyre corny because they make sure somebody is looking when they do anythinglol man your team won the chip but theyre objectively cornyhaha i knew my comment would trigger some okc fans relax bud its not that serious its not corny to have a sense of humor but there are ways you can become corny from that sense of humor you ever heard of corny dad jokesoh shoot i thought it was until you said something glad you cleared that upbro has the pajamas and everything lol nahh tatum literally texted a dead man stop itoof youre in the doesnt know how to act after winning a championship arc of fandom dont worry youll figure it outpeople are always gonna hate from afar and i get it cause when i was younger id engage in the bs really its just best to ignore this shit and in all fairness it is corny but fuck it let him enjoy the hes a young adult who won a championship i just think him entertaining the negative comments with a weird overreaction comment makes him look silly and insecure everyone taking it way too seriouslydeletedthe moment he lost a lot of peopleyeah but scott foster gave him telepathic steroids or something so it doesnt count only players i like can be goodyou can tell all these people in the comments are either young teens who never watched kobe played or miserable adults who have nothing going for them and are just living their life with regretsthat made me chuckle i knew we won after he did thati dont know why yall trying to make it a money thing you couldve left it at talentless lolpic is corny its alright brohe seems like the type to think about it later while in line at dairy queendeadbeats pay women im pretty sure ant has paid all his child supportgood point im not actually suredoesnt the nba do revenue sharing lolsomeone thats x better than this dude lolnot convincingyep everyone clowns tatum for his kobe worship because he plays for the celtics just like how people are clowning jdub now its solely because jdub plays for the thunder no other reasoni pile on with the thunder refball jokes as much as anyone on here but i think jdub is real for this onedefinitely was mrsunsfana modinvestigate a suns fan account that glazes kd all the time that suddenly became inactive somehow and look for a rockets counterpartlol nah not even the most terminally online person on earth understands how much of a life a mod lacksnot one not two not threewhy they do whatnow hes gotta come back from the injury mega washedtrue new idea first one to shoot a ft between hali and tatum winscolorado nextandits corny but doesnt have anything to do with legacy lmao its not that deepyeah im a bit confused how does recreating a pic supposed to ruin your own legacy im just guessing jdub did this for fun and not seriouslyhow is taking a single picture even close to getting a mans name tattooed on youalso you made a post unironically saying ja morant should sue the nba for harassment if we want to talk about cornylol what tons of people did and more should havefor the first several years of his career there was a lot of talk about how kobe was the knockoff version of jordan emulating the game but with a selfish ball hog mentality in place of the killer instinct which of course is funny because jordan himself was accused of being a ball hog who would never be a winner for the first several years of his careerlol yes we didwell because kobe had aurai think youre right actually still corny af to text a dead person and then show ppl you did itweird too as holding water is super easy i do it all the time and almost never spill anyand that makes it go from corny to fucking lameill give it to you that was funny shai still a fake ass superstar thoughlol triggerednobody thinks about jalen williams except thunder fans brodont kill the corny part of you kill the part that says cornycorny is just what they label players when theres nothing rational or genuine to criticize them about theres nothing wrong with paying homage to one of your idolsexactlybut hali doing the reggie choke in msg very coolthis is the same shit as tatum and just as cornyyou mean kobe the rapistare we referring to the rapist kobeas an aside i dont think its about that its about getting up leaving your pjs on and going to the gym to emulate a photo then posting it everything is nostalgia and nothing is authenticremovedyour user name is a washed soccer player that never made it big youre driding a failure talking about corny lmaoat least hes not mimicking the courtroom photos rightso thats not corny thats tone deafthen again some of you are so illiterate you dont know the difference between those wordsif someone doesnt find issue with the imitation they might just see it as honoring a basketball mentor i see it at thatbut if someone does find issue corny doesnt cut it the deeper discomfort is moral not stylistic but then again some of you are too smart to understand thatcorny became this echo chamber around stupid people who just love to play moral highground against literally anything even tho the words most of the time doesnt belong anywhere around the contexti get the rapist part but pedophile can you explainhe should get shit talk for paying homage to one of the all time greats yeah youre a fucking loser get off the internet and get a life how about you go touch some grassyoud rather he have no interactions with fanshe responded to every commentwhy it was a pretty good response and hes probably rightyoud rather players have no interactions with fansyou are way saltier in these comments than he was lol bunch of children on this suboh nooo he looks worse because you said so ahhhhh doesnt make him look better to whose eyes yours i dont understand why people think public figures are mythical beings incapable of speaking with other humans if they wantyeah no shit its objectively the best strategy but we arent perfectly objective creatures dawg thats my whole point i dont expect people to behave in an objectively correct way at all times even when theyre famous athletes its just tiresome when people on this site go off about what public figures are supposed to do all the time what he actually said was yeah i think the people who make fun of me for that photo are losers which is a totally fair thing for him to say and if you edit the royal you not you specifically have a problem with that youre softer than baby shit dont dish it out when you cant take itthat thing you did was cornyoh yeah well im way better at basketball than you aregot emyoure describing an insecure replylol you right can we please just beat them onceyeah youre delusionalyoure actually delusional no just because reddit says they do everything for attention doesnt mean they do i promise you are far more pathetic in every way and far more obsessed with how the world thinks about everything you do than anyone on this teamit wouldve been cringe for me to respond to that baitfigure out what yes he would be called corny as wellprojectingthe reply tickled my brain in a unique wayso hes gonna get money no matter what great go off then no one isnt gonna watch other teams cause of this commentthat would answer why those mods banned posting womennah wed find out after all the kd slander got deletedman i would love thatjayson tatum now takes the helicopter to practiceplzzzzzso whats williams gonna do to keep up with thathes committed to the bithe likes kobe takes a picture of him dressed like kobe its not that deepdeletedyou dont see how posing for a photo which is then shared across the internet isnt similar to a tattoo which can be removed on someones skin is similar i dont know what to tell you i still stand in my ja comment nba and all the talking heads bashing morant were corny and just trying to further harm that mans image how about you go do something productive rather than sliding into peoples history loserbut youre never gonna hold his watercongrats you literally just figured out the meaning of the figure of speechwell now he starts the season with free throws thanks a lotflair up homiefake ass superstar with a real ass ring and mvp fmvpcry more nerdit is especially obvious when so many people in these comments are seething at the fact he basically called them losers lmaois conry only just what they label players when theres nothing rational or genuine to criticize them about when talking about sports or everything because it seems like you use it but maybe its different when you use itthis sub wont let me link it but search conry in your comment history and you use itediti guess they can call it out and use it as an insult must be nicecorrectprobably because it was organically pretty much an identical moment clutch shot where they both thought they were up but they eventually won anywaysobjective very cool after the comeback they mademaking a big shot helps having it happen spontaneously in the moment helps not posing and meticulously editing a post for clout you guessed it helpskids these days they think doing the same pose they see on kobe posters makes them more like kobe you wanna copy kobe send us a pic of you practising at am or making a game winning shot or scoring pts but nah lets send kobe a voicemailbecause he thought they just won after making a historic comeback in the garden that was very much warrantedhaving just done a clutch shot to potentially seal the game is a more organic way for it to come out than staging a photo shootyesthat was very cool and never felt lame mainly because it was naturalorganic great examplebecause he actually recreated the momentwhat iswhatever you want to call himwhatever you want to call himwtf oh you mad mad this morning huhbruh what paulo dybala was a staple in my fifa franchisesgod forbid a teenager had a favorite player when he made his account rightthat would be hilarious rather than cornyi aint reading all thatdoes anyone else have trouble understanding what this user is sayingfeels like a rough draft essay where placement of words and phrasing havent been thought out yetall i know is the pic was cornier than my kelloggs breakfast cerealhe picked up his wife at a high schoolkobe was and vanessa was when they met there was some interview where kobe says he knew right away that she was the onewhen tonahill asked kobe what he saw in the yearold he responded shes pure and innocent and not jaded by the world is scum i dont have any problem with people giving players shit when they reference him sorry not sorry maybe he shouldnt have been a rapist not to mention the ages when he started dating vanessaso you want him to respond to all comments in this thread toono but the idea that he needed to respond was brought up by one user so this other user is saying if it was a press conference sure but not in his comment sectionit really wasnt it was condescending hes acting like because hes a rich professional athlete that no one else is entitled to an opinionwhy is it always extremes he can just be more selective with what he answers if i went on and commented hey what do you think about the people that say youre an overrated idiot im not one of them i wouldnt expect him to answer if someone asked what do you feel is the most challenging aspect of being a pro baller or something that matters id expect some fan interactionjalen said couldnt hold my water thats an arrogant thing to say imagine if sga or steph curry said thatnew on this sub is filled with some of the biggest losers on reddit tbhlmao ok bud sorry i insulted someone you like but itll be okedit you and this other moon dude seem to share very similar opinions lmao that your alt actlmao youre weird it doesnt take a genius to see he looks petty by saying that i dont care what he thinks thats how it looks and i dont care if you agree clearly others do agreeanybody who has a functioning brain not you kobe or okc fans though plenty of ways to respond about haters without being so salty doesnt change my opinion of him everyone can be salty at times but acting like he doesnt seem petty and childish for that response is just stupidcare to add some more emojisthats not what he said of course we can all understand the human impulse to want to respond to haters and put them in their place but when youre a public figure how have to a be aware and expect that hate comments will come and b have the selfcontrol to not reply to them and just move on for your own sanity for instance no one says that kd isnt allowed to respond to randoms but is it good for his personal peace and wellbeing to be reading all his mentions and clapping back at randos probably not theres always gonna be haters just have to ignore emi think if the line for you to respond is someone calling you corny then youre in for a long unnecessary stressful time in the public eye if you cant handle the negatives of being a public figure then play basketball in your backyard if not just wipe your tears with the millions of dollars you get played to play a game and move onthat really showed emthe kd speciali just dont agree with that at allexplain how its insecureposting an aurafarming post of an iconic kobe moment which is just him in a dumb outfit sorry thats just attention grabbing like oh look at me you remember this deep kobe referencehow to spell the word shit properlythere isnt even a dairy queen where i livesometimes you just have to admit you made a dumb comment and not delete it igtickle deez nutswell yeah but your whole first argument was wrong is alli would love the sixers last second round appearance for the decade to be when tatum dropped the most points in a game on the mvpgo to coloradoasking others to be productive while overanalyzing a fun pic some guy took is idk its somethingwe host guys all the time for about k for charity or themselves i can get many stars to give a brief talk to our clients and hold his water i have held beliceks tigers and several others waters while they putted or spoke i handed both bo jackson and barkley drinks multiple times frank thomas handed me a beer one time so he can probably hold water too i was very young but fished with dr j that isnt related to this but is cool as hellbut he said i couldnt not that i wouldnt i am clutch like that and willing to bet i can if i am ever called on to do so these are just regular guys who are already rich and famous and will be getting very rich which is awesome for themwow thanks now look up jokes and sarcasmand i didnt literally just figure it outthat no one outside okc respects conryremovedi mean tatum has done all those dont need to send out a pic to get satisfaction while doing those the best homage you could give to kobe while doing them is to keep working like kobe didin jdubs defense he literally did echo kobe spontaneously in the moment he got the same injury in his wrist during the post season that kobe did and went out and still played on it with a bunch of injections in his wrist like kobe did even putting up in a pivotal game but agreed posting about it after is kinda cornydont be rude man you know they dont have schools in oklahomanot mad pointing out facts and irony sorry if it hurt you toothanks for letting me know he was great in your fantasy lmaoyeah dawg thats cringe as hell lmao dork ahh naming yourself after other people hahathat would be hilarios rather than cornyhey man dont bring nene into this shitcoolstill commented tho enough to get your attentioneveryone understand this including youotherwise you wouldnt be here i touch it where it hurts you joke about this to make it look like you got something at mecos again i touch it where it hurtswhat kind of dummy reply to something they dont understandspecifically because she was innocent and pureshe was senior in high school not much better but no need to exaggerateshes a little under years younger than him so cant be right hes still weird though since i read he was picking her up from school and got banned for itso your definition of a pedophile is being with someone or youngermaybe players reference him because of who kobe was on the court i know it may be hard for your peanut size brain to understand but people can still appreciate a player for their on court play while also realizing and disliking who that player was off the court its the same thing with musical artists theres lots of pos artists out there but you can still listen and like the music they make while also hating the person that they are its not that hard to comprehend you guys care too muchhes corny im weird and youre right and you know you are because others agree with you got ityoure running out of vocabularycare to add some more insight than saltyheres another emoji for you since youre easily triggered go outsidebut the comment hes responding to isnt a hater they asked a question about why it doesnt bother him and he responded to that i really dont see why thats so unhealthy its not like he went up and down the thread telling people theyre stupidi get what youre saying but his comment is effectively challenging the guy to say that in person by saying the guy wouldnt say it in person hes acknowledging that the comment bothers him why would he otherwise not be told it in personprobably because youre insecureany man who go must say i am the king is no true kingits insecure because hes looking through his comments and actually responding to it by calling this guy out in particular for not being courageous enough to say that in real life he is acknowledging that the comment bothers himattention grabbing is doing anything for views not making an homage to your favorite player on your public personal pageplease explain how this is aura farming or attention seekingyou really showed himwell it was a sarcastic comment soyou could make an entire embiid defensive lowlight compilation just from tatum cooking him over and over in game cathartic ending to the seriessome people would call it corny almost like getting a tattoo of rmaxfuckla on youthis guy holds waterreal ball fans do bandwagonning box score watchers dontoh no not one of us cares about that at all enjoy your cope while we enjoy the glory of a championship for eternityim so surei like outside okc so youre already wrong so what has to happen for a real ring aside from it being won by your favorite player lil brothis sub wont let mea rush you get to call people out but when others do it is a mental illness you like playing by rules you dont followyou quick deleted saying you only did it once that was a liewats uh skoolthe pic is cornydybala had a good career you fucking jackassstop being so uptight its embarrassingyou cant be calling other people cringe dorks when you wont even say assyoure telling on yourselfim and yos are literally kids like what why r u acting like kobe was when they met lmaoit includes it yeslets break it apart pedophile means someone who is sexually attracted to children child means someone under the age of majority the age of majority is is under any further questionsif youre hell fucking yes do you not agreeforgot who it was but a comedian made a joke about this technically under and over like means ur an ephebophile but u cant say that cus it just makes u sound like a pedophilemaybe they do bud i dont carei understand the concept of separating the artist and the art like kanye for examplesome of his old music is great but hes a cunt ass mofodoesnt mean you cant rag on people paying homage to someone you think is a pos liking art from a pos is fine but praising them is more than thatand you care too much about the opinions of people that care too muchbe the change you want to see in the world and stop commentingbasicallyhes corny im weird and youre righttook you long enough damnidk why this is so hard to grasp for you but its definitely not worth my time to explain it to you with how dense you arenah just a difference of opinionhe responded to comment dude what the fuck lmao by your logic youre the most insecure man on earth for responding to me timesyou wouldnt ask me that if you saw me in person probably just ask for a selfielol youre on my dickyoure back pedaling lolreal ball fans dont enjoy watching a flop artist walk his way to the ft line after every slight breezewe jdub got a turd in his pocketusing lil bro unironically is the second corniest thing right after jalendude you have a okc flair what a surprise you dont think this fake ass chip means anything the biggest refjob since the lakers vs kings lolcaruso and dort would foul out in the first quarter playing defense against sgalmfao yeah i said that comment had bud years deep in my comment history so he could own me with a screenshot of me calling an indie album cornytwo years ago on rfantanoforever bro im cryingagreedyeah my favorite part was when he lifted an european trophy or his great involvement in the nti dont care about the opinion some dweeb over the internet in my eyes youre embarrassing for entertaining me during my post workout coffeeyoure probably arguing with a literal year oldirony lmaonot really people are so quick to throw out the word pedophile especially to someone they dont like child means someone under the age of majoritythat is definitely not what child means in any context other than legal and pedophile is not a legal term that would be child molester or something similar the age of majority is through much of south east asia would kobe cease being a pedophile if he moved to indonesia conversely its in mississippi if hed met vanessa there would it simply have been a case of two kids hooking updont get me wrong is skeezy as fuck but like words mean things you are very much misusing the words child and pedophileactually that is not what pedophile meanspedophilia alternatively spelled paedophilia is a psychiatric disorder in which an adult or older adolescent experiences a primary or exclusive sexual attraction to prepubescent childrenthe prepubescent part is important kobe dating a teenager when he was a year old millionaire is gross and wrong but its not pedophilia actual pedophiles are much much worseso everyone in italy is a pedophile since they have an age of consent of if you ask an italian they would not agree their age of consent is sorry im holding a press conferencewow weve hit the youre dense phase already thats like the out of office reply of subreddit arguments automatic impersonal and a clear sign youve got nothing left in the tank take a lap and regroup lolheres another emoji for souvenirare you going to answeryou really showed meim not lol how was my first comment wrong i was told that a ton i didnt say anything about revenue sharing and if fans stop watching basketball in general cause of jalen williams instagram comments they are softer than charmin i hate this subreddit cause its a bunch of nerds who take everything so literalproving youve literally never watched a single game while still talking shit about them is certainly a choicethunder living rent free in your head for yearsi guess the difference between you and me is that im a dad thats happily married and i dont give a fuck if im a corny youre just a bozo that thinks people carekeep repeating that npc casual fan nba take youre js exposing yourself that you dont actually watch the gamesflair upso you calling people out is okay but mental illness when done against youyou can use corny but call out othersyou use it multiple times on multiple threadsdang its all you didso where you wrong then or nowstop using emojis its cornynot arguing with him pointing him how ironic his comment iswhat the fuck is this argument also is way too low as the age of consentwell not everyone if im also but if im and the other person is thats fucking mad weird manif youre and date a year old youre a fucking sicko im gonna go out on a limb and guess that not every italian adult isnt horned up for teenagers and that there are plenty who would agree with me and the sentiment that just because the age of consent is doesnt mean its morally okay to date a teenager if youre over a certain age or life stageyou are working really really hard to justify fucking year oldsyou are not going to magically convince rnba nah its actually fine brahthere are plenty of italians who would raise their eyebrow at a year old and a year old dating even when the law say its okayhes an idiot and you are dense two things can be true at oncewhy would i answer someone who cant even hold my water in real life later peasant im going to my mansion now and no we cant take a selfie youd prob be the guy to ask me for oneyoure misunderstanding i understand that you were going for sarcasm but the thing you were wrong about wasnt intentionally sarcastically wrong it was just wrong wrong whether or not okc is a draw jalen gets paid by fans of the nba not just fans of him so youre wrong because by that logic everyone who supports the nba can talk all the shit they wantyou seem real happy having to argue with people on reddit go spend time with your family lmaohow do you feel about black country new road and dream theater admittedly i really like bcnrs new direction with their third album it didnt knock me off my feet but i thought it was a nice all around solid return coming off the back of losing a key member however dream theater im still not very keen on ill always be more of an opeth guyyou cant readyou understand america isnt the only country in the world and doesnt set the rules for everyone right tell that to almost every government that isnt america just because something is weird to you doesnt mean youre objectively rightyou cant really throw morals into the equation when we are talking about whats legal and putting labels on people also italy isnt the only country south korea switzerland belgium and many more have an age of consent of or lower just because you dont agree doesnt mean you can dictate whats right or wrongno other countries are according to youinsane lengths yall reach to hate holy shitwhich correct me if i am wrong they dogood thing im not american keep fantasizing about fucking year olds tho or whatever it is youre trying to prove hereyoure quacking like a pedowell yeah youre still wrong with about your original comment which was my whole pointwell no i wasntokay let me dumb it down you said jalen can talk shit on fans because they dont affect his income because of the way profit sharing works fans do affect his income because thats how okc can afford to pay his contract in fact id say it affects his profit way more because a small market team like okc benefits way more from profit sharing than the lakers or celticsdoes that mean that i think people are going to stop watching the nba because of this comment no and i never said that does it mean that your whole premise is wrong and based on a misunderstanding of how the nba works yesand let me break it down to you buddy im aware of how profit sharing works my comment was that okc isnt a draw and doesnt get ratings which isnt true either but people say it is so i commented was told that okc isnt a draw and they dont get ratings the comment i replied to is ignorant cause people think that they are spectators and can say whatever they want to players online cause they are the reason they make millions so i commented my comment saying he doesnt have to pay attention to what they say cause no one allegedly watches okc holy hell this subreddit is unbearable cause i have to explain a one liner that i made real quick while taking my morning shit cause its a bunch of well actually the cba states nerds or guys that just watch highlightsif you dont want to be corrected dont make stupid comments it wasnt funny or correct just bitching about how your team is treated in a post about a player getting called corny for doing something cornydont think i bitchedwouldnt be the first time you were wrong today',\n",

if he is a complete bust which he wont be he will make more money in this contract than nick young the clown will ever earn in his lifehis mom is gunna take it allthe amount of money that is pouring into the league is astronomical and its the players who make it happendylans rookie contract is larger than his fathers nba career earningsso they gotta get rid of fox at this point then yaron harpers sonbro came a long way from the hood sim not tryna be a hater but that is a lot like its a lot you know at this point in a persons careerlooks like a kid from ja morant and dejounte murraypaying a year old rookie million a year is wildinvest well kiddo and live below the means reading all these old nba players being broke breaks my heartbro saw the number and glitcheddamn he looks like mannycrazyfortunate hes not a big man else shaq would get mad with that contractafter taxes and agents fees he should leave with about mwhat are the chances that hes broke in yearsin this economyhis dad made million during his entire careerhe keeps looking at it love itthis is how i look with my job when i get a raise for next yearthat wemby m contract is gonna be insanesave your money kid and invest wiselyfast food is almost trillion dollar business and people cant get a raise sports leagues are billion dollar businesses and they get everything they wantdeservetagay naapparently only the chosen ones can see the shaky videoclicked this thinking it was the other dillion harper real ones knowover paid but well seedo all nd picks get this or did the spurs give extraacting like he came from nba moneytoo much spurs gonna regretcant help but wonder if that money will bring him the happiness he thought he deserved or just a whole lot of stress with all those endorsement dealsafter deducting taxes and agent fee he probably still netting mil mil good for him years from now hell be on a podcast claiming his accountant took his moneyway too much money for an unproven prospect the pick should not be making more than millionthats more than unanimous mvp steph curry was making on his year dealalready mill more then his father earned in his years in the leaguei wish real life jobs worked like this i see job postings for about the same pay i did years agoimagine being a normal person making k a year and then signing a contract for mgenerational wealth right off the bat and you dont have to do shit must be nicelebron james year in miami m after playing gamesharper minutes played ma rookie with minutes earning almost the same as one of the best players ever in his prime is insaneits also even harder to be in nbamakes drafting busts with high lottery picks a lot more painful imagine paying guys like anthony bennett this muchshaq somewhere i hate dylan harper so muchi remember when nfl contracts had the first round first draft pick be paid years million dollars in and they changed that so the following year in cam newton signed a year millioncolleges completely fucked kids starting decades ago lul we cant pay you because you are amateursmax contracts are bigger than the whole ass salary cap from years agojoe johnson was overpaid making this muchhis dad played years and only made m never made an allstar team but he was a ppg scorer with good defense throughout his prime then his scoring dipped when he went to the bulls but i believe he was a starter or close to it for five championship teams he probably would have been making m a year these dayseverything price wise is inflated too bro from years agodeletedbidenflationi genuinely did not know rookie contracts were this much i thought they were like m for the whole contracttook the words out of his mouth it delayed his audio for seconds like a dubbed kung fu moviehis dads a lil bit of a psycho hopefully that hasnt been passed down seems like a good eggholy shit not even tryna conceal your karma farmingi dont like that hes buddies with ace baileyprobably shaking uncontrollably like he wasits even crazier when you realize this means that the organization believes theyll make more than that in revenue off just this one playeryeah i mean his dad made like million for his nba career so i have two things i took from this he grew up with a millionaire nba x champion dad so its not as nearly as shocking as it would be for of normal people his rookie contract is like million more than his dad made in his entire year nba career which is fucking crazy hahahookers and blow dawg hookers and blowgive me that damned pen nowthe lack of reaction to that is feeding into my dead internet theory fearsi thought it was just meaudio is also out of sync for meor a seizurelooks like a frame rate issue along with some camera shakethat camera is shaky like a jason bourne movie on methyeah i was like this video is trippy as heck lolhe was jerking off seeing all those si just noticed the audio delay didnt see any shaking also at a first watch i saw seconds only and then checked the comments its just a im blessed generic reaction loli dont know why but it actually plays more normal on the phone iphoneits the same isnt it both mil per yearthe franchise gots money to burnif youre actually legit good at basketball you can make even more money and then retire plus you want purpose in life but i get your sentimentif harper reaches his potential hes probably looking at what will be around a million dollar supermax its the nd contract thats the true goalive always thought it was crazy this didnt happen at least every few years someone decides you know what im goodi dont think you can get to that point without loving what you doayton is that youandrew bynumbarring a few exceptions i think most wont get there anyway if they didnt love the gamealso his dad played in the league for years so hes probably set either waywouldnt it be million is of a billionk is of a millionid put it all on redwin become a slumlordwin million become slumlordsdylan harpers a fraud doesnt even have the grit or hustle to squeeze wealth away from the middle and lower classesr u oklandlords are parasitesi know youre joking but too many people actually think like that capitalism is a mental illnessremovedand even then they are likely underpaid considering the value they provide people creating the product that fuels billion in team assets assuming billion average per team might be the most valuable labor in america on a person to person basisyou gotta remember he is better at shooting a ball than like percent of the rest of the planet if you myself or any other person were in the top percent of an industry that brings in billions we would be paid pretty handsomely as well lol but it does make me wonder does the worlds top teachers or doctors even make this muchyeah i thought it was like m year for a lottery pick but i guess they got a bumpdid you have a player optionmore than nfl guys too yeah the roster is bigger but stillcastle was last yearentitled fanbase toopeople are obsessed with it too both team and player moneyflair doesnt add upthis is my plan easy enough live off the interest for a middle class quality of life dont know where im gonna find a cool million thoughnot sure but i heard kon is going to sign for years mhis dad made million in career earnings i dont think he comes from a family that hurt for moneyall you cant give extra that would be cheating the salary capteams dont get to decide how much draft picks are paid thats not how it worksdoubt that hes a nd generation nba player the ones who usually have money problems are the ones who came from dirt poor situationsthe max salary in was million kobe damn now the rookies start out at more than a rd of that and steph still wants equity smhim out after the contracts up invest and doneprobably more than his father made in his whole careeredit yep i remember when the cap was spiked that year yes the kd joining summer that people are shitting on players like lin that got a bigger contract than currys crazy cheap one when he signed for just myr due to his injury in just years rookies are getting way over that crazybeing mediocre and injured until your third season will do thati feel like this is the part ppl are missing here thats how wild nba salaries are now a days that we got this kind of reaction from a dude that grew up the son of someone making millions per year where this was totally normalizedjordan really played against paycheck to paycheck part time plumbers he was born into generational wealthyou actually have to do quite a bit to be drafted to the nbaif you think that is insane you should look at some of the deals that were signed before rookie scale contracts were a thingglen robinson wanted a million contract when the entire bucks franchise was worth like millionpenny hardaway signed a year million contract that had an optout clausehardaways wasnt the only contract with an optout clause either as chris webber had an optout clause that kicked in after the first year is crazy but thats over years whereas lebron is almost making that amount per season nowwhy how sorockefeller had million in so not really the wealth of the has inflated much more than the working class americans will never be smart enough to know theyre in a class war and losing badlydeletedmaybe if regular peoples wages actually went up with inflation this would be truei think this is the dumbest comment ive ever readand its also inflated to the point that waiters of s money went way further and was more impactful than waiters in not all of them are that high it depends where a rookie is picked it drops off by about a million with every pick if you are a top pick lolthe high picks are but it drops down quickly the st year salary for is m this year while drops down to mwhyweirdo commentglad it wasnt just me because this video gave me a strokekinda insane that nba teams spend to m in salary for players alone and still be profitablenot necessarily the player themselves are probably worth less than that in actual revenue generated however the star players definitely generate multiple times their worth and by signing role players to higher than their direct value they have a better chance of competing and making the stars happy making them stay longer etcin a teams pl im sure a lot of players are loss leaders but as a combined group the players are greater than the sum of the individual partsthe dodgers are making a ton of money with ohtani and they gave him damn near every dollar they had well will eventually anywayright and his dad wasnt a scrub he was a ppg scorer until he went to the bulls and won championshipsbro lmao same i was like there is no way people watched this and didnt lose their mindthis subthread is literally the only one acknowledging dead internet for sure its an awful video beyond any shaking like fps lol i wasnt even aware it was shakingreality is most ppl comment without even playing the video they just imagine his reaction and comment based on thatman you aint lying ridiculousright i was like how is no one else talking about thisyeah audio is wacknah not frame rate its due to bframes not being rendered in display order correctlyaverage is the same but hes getting two more years and thats literally just twice the moneytrue and nba players get a ton of free time in the offseason anyways like if youre on a non playoff team thats almost months off you can find a lot of purpose with that much money in your account you dont need to keep playing ballwe could get to the stage where most people who makes allstar could reasonably become a billionaire at tax and myr spending money a m year contract leaves you with m after years of just returns thats b and thats if you leave after your contract if you get another m contract aftertoo much money left on the table i guessfor sure this happens always those good rookies then suddenly becoming bums after years in the league they just go out quiet some aim for the max contracts first then go bum im looking at you ben simmonsi feel it does sorta happen it just ends up looking like players who have motivation issues or who struggle to expand their gameits not going to be as common for someone to give it their all to the point of being offered another massive contract to then decide theyll just quithis dad earned mil his whole career dylan got the big pants nowim not gonna claim to know their finances especially since money back then wasnt like it is nowim sure he grew up comfortably but that doesnt mean youre set for life in todays world in a lot of cases chance you win you either win or you dontdid you learn nothing from wesley snipes some motherfuckers are always tryin to iceskate uphillidk anymore tbhyesits a joke bro u log offplease act civil and do not trollbait others of revenue not even profit is given to them thats only the case for a lebron and curry level playerno because doctors and teachers dont do their job on national tv in a and a half hour time slot where hours of that time is spent on advertisingand not just of the planet lets assume hes only the th best basketball player in the world that still means hes better than roughly of the world at basketballyou think i care to read i saw the big numbers and signed on the dotted linejust bird rightsbigger roster way fewer games shorter playoffs and nonqb players are more expendablerich get richer st th nd in a rowthe entire heatles team cost mdevin booker costs mequity makes sense when you consider steph had arguably the largest role in their valuation increasing by billion of dollars during his tenure steph has career earnings of less than mm the owners made good deals with the media but it was players like him who kept eyes on the screen and made those deals come to fruitionlike any other job imagine being responsible for of the success and only getting of the payoff obviously that figure is hard to calculate exactly so im just making a conservative estimatethe owners have equity and cant shoot a threeall workers deserve to have equity in their workthe stars are probably worth a lot more than theyre getting they drive all the engagement and revenue of the nba dylan harper is wonderful but people arent buying his jersey in other states or flying in just to see himthink of it like thisif teams can afford to pay these dudes millionwhat do you think the owners of the teams and nba are bringing in off these players i honestly dont blame the players for wanting more when theyre the reason the business is booming in the first place i promise you nobody is buying tickets to see miriam adelson or dumonts gap toof beaver looking ass ill tell you that muchcurry averaged on fga with steals in games his second year in the nbabeing mediocre and injured until in your third season will do thatftfyhe grew up rich as shit in franklin lakes nj one of the richest neighborhoods in the state people would ride around on garbage nights looking for brand new couches furniture etc because theyd just toss it after not using it or liking itfacts dudes on the cavs played at valley vista in the summer my buddies dad played against them he the goat though lmaoi mean with that example we can flip it and say jordan can to carry paycheque to paycheque part time plumbers to championshipstrue but what about the other draft picks more power to college athletes they can leave school with millions with nil and they deserve it must be niceand owners had to make rules to prevent them from giving out those contractsjust the level of athleticism size and skill since its a global sporthey wembyinflation is happeningyea bad analogy but u know what i meanplease tell me what he said lmaou know what i mean value of a dollar has gone downi chose the wrong analogy surewow first time im learning that all rookies earn different amounts what about picks though this website doesnt specify the scale for nonlotteryop using that temu softwareeasily their biggest cost i was curious and looked it up apparently spurs revenue for was m operating margins cant be easy to manage also another fun stat i just noticed difference between the revenue team warriors to the revenue team lakers is about the entire revenue of the grizzlies timberwolves magic or pelicans pick whichever you want to hate onrevenue sharing babbbbywhen hotdogs are dollars and beers are it makes sense fans getting screwedno a top pick is projected to make way more than the rookie maxtheres also a union so the players are a block and have to be paid a certain cut as a wholeuntil this chain of comments i thought my computer was just glitching or somethingi refreshed like times thinking it was a client side issuei thought that would be what of the comments would talk about and nothing else loli think its a combination of actual bots and people who never bother opening the video anymore so they just react to something they never watched they just assume hell be humble and excited because they infer it from the title and the first commentstheres no way this place isnt absolutely overrun with bots i read somewhere that over half of all activity on reddit is botsthe internet gets shittier and shittier every day i swear to godtechnically its a twoyear deal with two club options tied on for years and thats how all rookie scale contracts worksure but i guarantee if you give harper the choice hed prefer the year dealteams generally want a longer term deal for their rfa players like what austin reaves gotcams side is probably the one negotiating a shorter deal so he can hit ufa earlier and the nets would only agree if the nd year was a team option or something along those linesguys like lamelo ball living the life manmax contract and only really having to work from late september until early april every year guys that dont make the playoffs truly get months offyeah it makes no real sense to get out of the game early the average nba career is like five years if youre exceptional you might make it to like that means by youre done working for the rest of your life if you want if youre truly special and make it even longer the odds are youre still done with work by when you put it like this i can understand how some older players are salty about the younger playersm wouldnt even feed ron jr mil in career earnings is plenty many people making less than this bankrolling their dumbass kids actually percent of the time it works every timetheres a key and peel sketch about that lolthat is true imagine a heart surgeon doing a procedure and it being aired nationally with commercials lolwhat happened after you signedand two of them are guaranteed to be promising and they still got draft picks for the future spurs fans just blessed to have a great organisation like thatthats actually fucking insane god damnlower the fucking ticket prices and pay these guys less end threadyou cant say that in retrospect salaries are an investment and they carry risks such as people not performing the higher the risk the lower the value of the investment the higher the potential payout the higher the valuecurry was still paid a fuckton of guaranteed money thats a fair price for that investment if the players want equity that means sharing the risks as well as the payouts which means taking a massive drop in guaranteed salary i can tell you right now that most players would not want thisplayers take none of the risk they get paid the value of their contract no matter what the league could collapse tomorrow and these new franchise owners could be out billion not saying its likely but its nonzero id say the nba cba deal is one of the fairest labor agreements in this country of all revenue if amazon had this deal in place the average amazon worker would be making year vs the actual yeardoes kevon looney get equity how much think about all the other players that would have a say in how much they should get once that first domino falls it just doesnt make senselike any other job imagine being responsible for of the success and only getting of the payoff like that would actually be great in any business taking that much in pay a percent of yearly earningsprofit equity is like even more unlikely doesnt even make sense imoi think in trading where one person executes the trade using banks money is similar percent is very rare and very generous thought this was funny gags a trader made of the profits for this hedge fund in a year and well this is the quote about his bonus which would be a multiple of his base pay i would think is pretty greatgags claimed that when he asked the funds founder michael lerch for the payout in he responded im not going to pay you the bonus fuck you sue meso idk curry does ok supermax is guaranteed no such thing for traders and sometimes boss just says fuck you lol a trader has claimed that he was denied a performancerelated bonus by his former employer evolution capital management despite making per cent of the hedge funds revenue over his month tenurerobert gagliardi a former segantii capital management employee whose trades came under scrutiny during a widereaching us probe into morgan stanley alleges that evolution acted in bad faith by refusing to pay him a mn discretionary bonus despite the fact he had generated more than mn for the firm between april and march its not that hes wrong its more about how incredibly out of touch that sentiment isi think as a whole people are pretty fed up with the idea of rich getting richer so a guy with career earnings of half a billion and plenty more from sponsorships etc publicly squabbling with fellow billionaires over who should have more is pretty gluttonous sure he probably definitely provides more value to the warriors brand but its hard to care about that at all in the grand scheme of thingswe got some antilabor proowner weirdos up in heremaybe but when they already make million a year for their work im not going to feel too bad for them if they dont get equity on top of ithe played and games in his first five seasons all prior to the narrative that he was injury prone was crazy and honestly the warriors owe him so much backpay for thati drive walk around looking for empties on garbage nightwild to see a park name that i know ofhave played at i was too young in those days and basically had to watch gamesplay during down hours but the better games were at lions and oak in those days imosomething to the effect of waiters today make early s oil tycoon level money then someone pointed out that rockefeller was worth like m before antitrustits because theres not one second rounders negotiate their contracts and earn more than some first rounders though most struggle to get guaranteed contractslike others said they negotiate contracts separately it leads to interesting situations like wes matthews he got a deal from utah after summer league then got a deal from portland to get right into his second deal in year and was immediately making more money than everyone else from his draft classwhat about picks though this website doesnt specify the scale for nonlotterylottery picks refer to picks that were determined by the draft lottery picks for this years draft not all first round picksthat season was one of the worst in spurs history as far as popularity goes it was before victor joined and catapulted the team into headlinesbw before wemby my friends and i would be able to afford allinclusive suite tickets because demand was so low and all tickets were cheap now theyre priced well out of reach for mewow thats interestingi think a similar argument applies most lottery picks end up as negative value contracts but the good ones are worth so much that on average they are positive valuesame only reason i came to the comments was to see if it was just my phonereal shit samei thought similar sometimes my phone plays videos weird on like instagram so thought it was that over half of all activity on reddit is botslook im real okaywould a bot type something nuanced random like this poo poo pee peethats all comments on all platforms buddy other social media sites hover i am not an expert but i think the bot activity is probably not in normal posts like this but rather for promotional posts on other subredditsim not sure its that cut and dry plenty of rookies lose their luster within years mil is a big enough bag that you grab itand no i dont care that hes on a losing team and theyre empty styaok even then cam thomas should be making more than a rookie as hes proven himself scoring a night in the league esp considering harper could be a bustthe epitome of losing edgegetting paid for something they enjoy doing is the dream doesnt make sense to just stop the free money machinewhat about quality of life if a player gets out early and can still walk with out pain that is priceless with tens of millions already in the bank the issue is that nba players that i have reached that fork in the road have generally gotten there by an insane drive to be the best they will do almist anything to keep competing in that context the priceless quality of life issue of being able to walk without pain holds little or no valueyea but it doesnt account for inflation if he put say million of the million in the market over the years hed have a hell of a lot more than millionbut theres no need to pull the ladder upthats the mindset that leads to misery you having a lot is somehow not enough you need others to have lesstime to musk upare you regarded i sucked dickgreat at tankingambling money has completely reshaped the landscapeits now fully normalized with nearly every major player involved espn even operates its own sportsbookas long as games are being played sportsbooks will continue generating billions that revenue is flowing into media companies and pro leagues across north america through sponsorships partnerships and massive promotional dealsregardless of where you stand on this sweeping wave of legalization and policy change at least the money is making its way to the players and not just lining the pockets of a few ownerssomething is going happen in the next set of negotiations cable will likely be dead or damn near the end only a handful of streaming services make money and the local channels are losing moneyticket sales are just a bonus profit margin they make so much from the tv deals and sponsors that they have no incentive currently to make attending a game more affordable to the average person the nba like all business in capitalism will always prioritize maximizing current short term profits even if it has the possibility of hurting them in the long runthey are paying these guys this much so that they can increase the ticket prices in the first placefranchise defining players like curry lebron kobe jordan iverson are not paid their true value under the cba their value and contribution to their team value and revenue continues for decades after they retire and stop drawing salary this level of player definitely deserves conversation regarding equityemployees are compensated with equity regularlyand its revenue sharing not benefit its an insanely good deali get your point but amazon doesnt have a labor union so its not exactly the best case to use and the players do take some of the risk they literally put their bodies on the line every game they risk their careereasy answer no kevin looney does not get equity nobody was tuning in to see him and without disrespecting him he was the least important part of any of their teams he played his role well but lets not act like multiple other centers couldnt have easily filled the role steph damn sure deserves equity for being the main role in increasing the teams valuation by over x easymaybe they should get a revenue share instead then seems a lot more logistically feasible but would also basically break the cap for smaller marketsim not necessarily arguing for it i have no idea how those deals would be structured or if its even possible im just saying that it makes sense why hed be salty about itwho tf thinks kevon looney is the face of the warriorswell yeah the guy reportedly made this dough doing insider trading any firm trying to look clean is prob going to say yeah fuck you you dont get a bonus for fuckeryits not about feeling bad for them but at least making uber rich billionaire owners pay out some more if they can afford to pay mill payroll what they netting per year is almost inconceivablethis is a lazy revisionary take he had like a dozen ankle injuries over years and played thru them to be exact really was just a few incidents in years then the sustained injury in year from that they somehow convinced curry to take a contract in line with derozan holiday and tyreke evans also why some players would prefer to go undrafted if they are in the late nd bubble too allows them to choose their location and negotiate terms without being locked into a team owning their rightsno nd rounder is earning more than a st rounder the th pick got a year m contract the highest paid nd rounders were sion james and ryan kalkbrenner who both got year contracts for just under mafter duncan ad and before wemby bwyeah the only exciting thing that happened during that season was the alamodome gamehappy to hear that would be interested in the stats for recent years even then in with cheap tickets they were middle of the pack for revenue thoughif the bots only engage on the promotional posts then theyre very easy to spot there are ratios in the high s in terms of bots engaging with normal every day content vs the boost targetnot for a prospect of harpers caliber if he were on the open market i bet pretty much every team would be happy to double mil over years if not moreharpers ceiling is something cam can never reach tho as a way player with the sizeathleticism that can guard cam just doesnt have that unfortunately cam thomas is just in a weird spot for his skillset hes a bucket in the midrange while not being elite from nor have elite defplaymaking hard to find a clear spot for him on a contenders rosterright but even if they hate basketball it would still be a bad decision to stop sure they could retire off a rookie contract but anyone is showing up to a job that pays millions per year even if they hate it theyll likely flame out quicker but whatever at that pointyou dont even get after taxes let alone be able to invest that muchamericans collectively have lost each to sportsbooks since they became legal and that was a couple years ago so its probably higher nowits an epidemic that is wiping out gen z financially between this and klarna the financial future is very grim for young americansumm no thats the paying off part of an investment there are also players that are paid a lot yet nothing lasting comes off it thats the risk thats the balance the players were paid by taking that huge success into account otherwise their salaries would have been much lower right from the start and nobody gets any money at any pointplayers as a whole have an incredibly beneficial deal with that revenue sharing people dont realize how insanely good that is because its revenue not profit it carries zero risk and nets a fuckload of money thats almost unheard of in the rest of the business worldfor equity to be part of the equation that revenue sharing would have to diminish greatly at least that would mean much less money for everybody except the few lucky superstars who manage to convert their potential and for every lebron you will see tens of superstars with equity worth less than current contracts doso yeah players wont want thatsuperstars who have contributed could maybe want equity after the fact but its meaningless if you dont get that during the risky part of the investment but then at this point you dont actually know who will be that legend that makes the investment worth itpeople forget steph and lebron have outside income rolling in also from all their sponsors deals and tieins they have guaranteed contracts and on jury taking them out multiple years they still pay that moneyi get it the warriors owner made a fuckton but he risked and leveraged it into the behemoth it is today had the right people finding the right players teams passed on him due to injury prone gsw benefited by drafting and him flourishing in a system that was designed to help him get to where he isthose players also benefit massively from the risk their teams take in elevating them to that megacelebrity status the platform that gained them that audience was delivered to them by the nba and their team the training facilities and connections that gain them insane sponsorships etctheir team and the league will purposefully get their name plays and therefore image more air time in a winwin tradeoffthose players receive a lot more from the league and their team than just their salaryjordan doesnt work here since in his time he was making more than the entire salary cap and more than entire rosters due to silly birds rights rules but yes lebron steph and such do deserve the sameyes as a substitute for a higher amount of salarysame as any job to be honest many trade jobs take even more of a riskequity or salary you cant have both when youre not taking the financial riskok klay or draymond then kdwhere does the equity line end and who decides itso how do decide who deserves equity their teams tv ratings their social media engagement or maybe its a stupid thing that only a man born into a rich family who is probably worth a half a billion dollars and has been shown to be so detached from the real world would sayhe works in an industry where the employees are legally obligated to receive of the revenue their employers get do you think basically anyone else gets that id bet the average employees are getting of the revenue maybe nba players get a much better deal than practically anyone else the fact that were listening to a nepo baby who makes million a year complain that he deserves more is disgusting go support a local strikes struggles instead of a multimillionairesnah man he has leverage for this and hes gonna be walking without equitythey get of basketball related income right now imagine if your job did that put of income aside give it out as bonuses to the employees based on contribution that is literally the capthats innuendo the man was never charged with a crime he was simply mentored by someone who was convicted but had his conviction overturned along with others recentlyso this mans mentor is no longer a criminal the only criminal is someone who would employe a licensed trader let him make you percent of your revenue and you use your discretion not to give him his bonus and you curse at him that guy is the real criminal michael lerch of evolution capital management the one who said im not going to pay you the bonus fuck you sue melolno its very conceivable some teams already barely break even some even occasionally operate at a loss sure a team like the warriors can afford to pay even more but setting a precedent of giving equity to players screws over the smaller teams with relatively poorer ownershe did play through them in years he was still one of the top rookiessophomores in the league in year he finished top in mvp voting and top mvp in year and made the allstar team it was his rd year that screwed him over for that rookie extension and the only year the ankles truly impacted his playof course they are filipowski for example has been making million a year he now made million in guaranteed nba money while many later first rounders do make below million and the backend of their contracts arent guaranteedback home at the domethey were selling tickets for like bucks and advertising like crazy to break the recordunless youre like lebron who has the poise and confidence to reject figure deals as a rookie any drafted player would see those numbers and just immediately sign fuck yesand seeing his reaction here i dont think itll be any different in his caseidk i think id retire after mil if i actually hated ball there is literally nothing i want to do that costs close to that muchnow i love basketball and if i were one of the best in the world at it you can bet your ass id be grinding for rings as long as i could but if it were a sport like football or something i have no interest in and just talented my way to a fat contract yea im out gonna go travel and paint or somethingi hope were gonna look at social media and gambling apps in the future the same way we view smoking cigarettes nowthis comment and the comment you replied to both sound like essays players as a whole have an incredibly beneficial deal with that revenue sharing people dont realize how insanely good that is because its revenue not profit it carries zero risk and nets a fuckload of money thats almost unheard of in the rest of the business world for equity to be part of the equation that revenue sharing would have to diminish greatly at least that would mean much less money for everybody except the few lucky superstars who manage to convert their potential and for every lebron you will see tens of superstars with equity worth less than current contracts doi dont understand why youre acting like the current status quo has originated from a perfect free market and that everyone has what they deservesalaries have greatly inflated but equity has increased even more theres nothing wrong with players pointing that out in the next round of negotiations in order to get a more favorable deal there are many ways to structure these deals which could involve equity if you use your imagination a bitif employees can be given stock options why can players not get shares of the teams equityyou dont need to offer equity to every player or in the beginning of their careerthe supermax has strict eligibility requirementshave it so equity has even more requirements past supermax as a reward for the few select players who demonstrated the value over the course of a career just like in other business where partnership is a possibilityonly for his last two years on the bullsand they should be able to get equity in the company they work for as wellok then just allow buy in by players as part of the comp packagewhat do you think employee stock purchase plans are like every major employer offers that lolexactly my point but some will play thick headed and not understand how a formula aka your line comment works and how and why the person determining it gets to determine it the whole thing is not possibleit actually allows those teams to compete more and would incentivizes stars to go to to smaller markets to build them upif nd stint cavs could have given lebron say like of the cavs he may have stayed in cleveland and continued to drive up the value of the cavs earning himself even more money increasing value for the poorer owners who wouldnt have been able to get lebron to stay otherwisetheres no way the lakers would be able to do that same deal because lakers are worth so much already adding lebron would give them a much smaller relative return on investmentfilipowski made more because he did not have annual increases in his contract just m per year but his total contract value m is less than the th pick of the first round mtyler kolek was the next highest paid and he made less than the th pick of the first roundin nobody drafted in the nd round signed a larger contract than a st rounder in it doesnt look like anyone did either although it worked out for ayo dosunmu because he took a year deal instead of the to that everyone has taken the last years and got an extensionjust saying its pretty rare that it works outi dont understand why youre acting like the current status quo has originated from a perfect free market and that everyone has what they deservei never said that im saying the current deal is good for everybody involved sure some players are overwhelmingly more valuable than others but they dont play in a vacuum they also depend on the quality of the rest of the league having everybody well paid is beneficial to the whole league and thanks to revenue sharing that means it benefits everybody in a virtuous cycle theres nothing wrong with players pointing that out in the next round of negotiations in order to get a more favorable dealof course theres nothing wrong with that but the value of the league depends directly on the profit it makes which depends on the revenue revenue that is already shared with the playersthe exact valuation of the league is volatile and depends on future expectations its not a certainty and carries a risk and as its not publicly traded you wouldnt be able to do much with that anyway players are as fairly compensated as you can imagine with the current deal even when considering the growth of the leagues revenue each year what curry is complaining about is that hed like some of the potential future growth as well except right now which is possible but again not a smart thing to want compared to the current deals because it could come at the expense of guaranteed income that scales directly on revenue its also never smart to speculate on your own product hedge your betsbut then that equity isnt worth much more if at all if you give it after the growth has happened its just flat money players are as fairly compensated as you can imagine with the current dealthats such a wild assertion to makei think i sort of see your point but the growth of the league continues and the player can make the decision on whether he wants to be paid in terms of equity or salaryi think there is a set of criteria where it would make sense i wouldnt lock it the team like supermax but allow other teams to offer equity where the players could then more directly contribute to more immediate growth of that franchisewell sure but the league grows off the back of every single player and employee just because some contribute more doesnt mean only them should reap the long term profits and there isnt an infinite amount of equity to give around you could have some of it vested for a few years after retirement and then a forced buyback but as i said it would come with a comparatively huge reduction in salary any financial advisor will tell you that its better to get the highest contract you can and then just invest that instead of putting all your eggs in the same basket pun intendedand again the players are all paid very fairly for their contributions with zero risk what happens after is irrelevant as that deal is already very good even considering future growth they could be paid with equity today as well with a lower salary of course but it only makes sense if they all have that optioni just wanna say i really enjoyed reading a actual sports conversation with differing opinions and not a single sentence was rude or condescending keep doing you my manyou make sound points i dont agree with your final conclusion as i think there should be a way to reward the curries and lebrons more but it was a good successioni just wanna say i really enjoyed reading a

notkyrie is such a loser lol seriously one of the biggest losers on the planetas time passes i lowkey appreciate no longer feeling attached to a team coached by a wife beater with a flatearthing coviddenying antisemitic superstar thank you nicoi think kyrie is acting like a jealous manchild he doesnt want to be coached by someone who is a better pg than he was his ego is so fragile he couldnt take it he didnt want to be coached by someone who was a twotime mvp that played the same position as himthis is how i use to write essays when i knew nothing about the topicshocker kyrie isnt very bright in october brooklyn nets nba basketball player kyrie irving tweeted a link to hebrews to negroes wake up black america in two news conferences after he made the tweet irving refused to apologize and declined to disavow antisemitism or the hebrews to negroes film on november the nets suspended irving without pay after his suspension irving tweeted an apology via instagram and agreed to donate to unspecified causes and organizations that combat hate the antidefamation league adl rejected irvings donation the groups ceo jonathan greenblatt said irving had failed at almost every step along the way to do the right thing apologize and condemn antisemitism and added we were optimistic but after watching the debacle of a press conference its clear that kyrie feels no accountability for his actions hebrews to negroes wake up black america is a film directed written and produced by ronald dalton jr the film espouses antisemitic messaging and spreads misinformation it contains antisemitic tropes holocaust denial and claims of an international jewish conspiracysorry but kyrie still sounds uneducated as everall this praise hes been getting since arriving to the mavs is because his money got threatened and that incentivized him to not act outhes so maturehes such a professional now and you know what percent of the league are professional as well and they arent praised for it its like being praised for brushing your teethyour supposed to do thisi dont get what everyone is so confused about here kd was friends with nash and pushed for him to be hc kyrie probably didnt agree with the move but he respected the decision and just let it happen steve nash turns out to be extremely inexperienced and underprepared for the job so now everyone is trying to respectfully beat around the bush and avoid the truth of the matter that it was a bad idea and you probably shouldnt get your friend hired to be your headcoachin my high school there was this kid named matt total fuck up he only cared about smoking pot always fucking around he had a really high pitched annoying voice with a speech impediment buck teeth got arrested a few times nothing majordipshit high school stuff hot head and he was dumber than box of hammers but he had a hog were talking ron jeremy level here he had this weird aura that a certain girls liked you can probably guess why we were jealous why did this moron get that anyway when i think of kyrie and his singular prodigious talent with a basketball im reminded of mattsomeone please take away the microphone from this mankyif you were truly committed to this as you say why not speak honestly to kd about your reservations about nash like these nba dudes are always so open after the fact but in the momentthey cant be honest to one another its glaze first and criticize later when youre so far removed from the situationkai back on his bullshitmy iq dropped by after reading and hearing this jesusimagine all the coddling that needs to happen to deal with this paranoid airhead yeah he was the problem in brooklynthe fuck is he sayingbro shd just take accountability and move on its obvious he has some irks about his behavior during that time its also obvious that kd and nash are basically calling him out without saying his namekyrie is another fake intellectual he will never be half the man steve was a playerbro is crashing outfor someone as enlightened as he thinks he is he sure is inarticulate but maybe the power of his intellect is in deciding his bullshityall are deadheads on these commentsif the fatherfigure reporter had asked what lebron meant to ky as an older brother would we be in a different timeline right nowhes saying steve was white and he didnt want a white head coach thats why hes dancing around it so muchhe kyrie didnt want steve as a coach for those of you confusedwhati like kyrie more than most on here but oh my hes on a hall of fame yap session recentlybro needs to gather his thoughtsmavs fans are about to find out what cavs celtics and nets fans have been warning them about now that hes got his moneykyrie further proves that live streamers are almost exclusively awfulwatching kyrie try to explain anything is literally just seconds of boomhauer talking you understandsir this is a wendyswow so many videos from this antivaccer latelywill pay people to stop posting this boring garbagesteve nash is a great coach bruh kyrie was mentally fucked up in the head that season steve wasnt the issue kyrie was the problem and kd played like trashkyrie could be a smart guyemphasis on couldkyrie needs to stop talking he sounds dumb as shit every time he opens his mouththis man is spiraling lolthis loser called himself a leader lolthese idiots think they dont need a coachthey can barely fucking readhes a lying sack of shitkyrie is trying to in realtime make himself look like a great teammate while making it clear he didnt like steve as a coach but went along with it like a good solider to support kd lmao hes so ridiculous it wasnt steves fault giannis stepped under kyrie and took him out and it wasnt steves fault harden reinjured his hamstring or that kd got hurt again there is only so much a guy can do when his three best players play a total of games togetherphil jackson would have won titles in chicago if mj scottie and horace grantdennis rodman played games togetherso no one wants to points out that kyrie is just a massive racist pos who couldnt handle being coach by a white pg that most fans view has better then himis nash a good coachsometimes kyrie just needs to stfukyrie is the worst guywere due for some kyrie fo beeffurther proving why brooklyn didnt workkyrie is such a nothing burger of a person manat least kyrie is just opining on his basketball exp and not acting as a public intellectual on the shape of earth or the efficacy of vaccineswords were said by kyrie irvingi wish i had my soundboard for thisthese two are ridiculousyall are weird mancoolidiotdid kyrie want someone else specific as a coach or he basically wanted himself and kd to run their own sets and just wanted nash to be just there just for the title of coach but no power because i remember them saying they dont need a head coach on podcastwhatwhatcant imagine being this cringeyeah i guess he was not batman to lukass robin hes been two face all alongkyrie is so dumb does he really think hes saying somethingwhy do people say mans like thisso this version of kyrie is back againkyrie james james harden called kevin a great older brother after the boston game what type of older brother role has he played for you and your teammatesthis guy loves to yap just get to the fucking pointthat duke education shining right throughkinda deranged behavior for kyrie to be doing this but i guess hes got nothing else to do and its better than trafficking in antisemitism so its cool lolalways thought he had a big ass ego him crying over the lebron comment just shows thatkd kept trying to replicate golden state type of play everywhere he goes no focus on defense kylie said a whole lotthat made absolutely no sense nice job kyrieall kyrie has to say is shaka when the walls fellsounds like a shitty kid in school trying to gaslight his teacher i have no idea what he is saying tbhif you isolate a sentence kyrie sounds brilliant sometimes and the rest of the time im not sure what the hell hes even sayingkyrie definitely didnt want to be coached by a white guyi increasingly feel bad for nash who had to coach this grouphe has figured out how to leave it vauge on everything from flat earth to racism to commitment he is as elusive off the court and on streaming as he is with ball u legit cant figure out where he is going or how he got therehim and murda mook would get along pretty welli feel like im not gonna say shit but you know what im saying is kyrie as a person paraphrasedwhat a schmuck kyrie isit seems more and more to me that kd wasnt the problem on the nets the only problem he had was choosing kyrie to team up in the first place because they are friendswhat does the word government mean to yousteve nash eyes glazing over having to patiently listen to this like its deepi think he is saying he likes stevethis is such a hilarious situation that unfortunately makes kd look terrible too and adds more to the belief hes among the worst leaders of alltime players on his tier or betterkyrie said nets only cared about kdnot him and that he had the issue with atkinson kd obv got him fired for kyrienext scenario is kd picking nash as his boy and kyrie not liking nash then it ends with kd demanding a trade unless nash and marks another person kyrie disliked is fireddude basically did what kyrie wanted every time and kyrie couldnt give him a season without dramawait theres literally a clip of him saying that he had reservations about nashkyrie is a phenomenally skilled player but gd i wish he would shut tf upis this just the rkyrie subreddit now every other post is some quote from himjust dribble dumbassluka was the one keeping kyrie saneas a younger brother so kyrie doesnt have an older brother kd is his older brotherforgot to pick up his haldol this monthi think winning a championship with bron got too much in kyries head in his mind he carried bron to that championship instead of the other way aroundim convinced people just hate him to hate him hes not saying anything crazy here whats the issuekyrie joined brooklyn because of kd not knowing steve nash was gonna coach kyrie doesnt like steve nash but joined anyways because he was all in on kdthe only thing that really fucked the nets up during this time was injuries and kds big ass footwe need kyrie back on the court asapi asked chatgpt to explain this quote not sure if this is better or worsethis quote is from kyrie irving and hes reflecting on the hiring of steve nash as the head coach of the brooklyn nets heres a breakdown of what hes sayingsteve wasnt even in the play yetkyrie is pointing out that steve nash wasnt initially considered a serious candidate or part of the coaching discussions at least from his perspectivebut this is your kd manshes addressing kevin durant kd indicating that nash was durants guy someone durant liked and supportedthis is your mans so i gotta support thatout of respect or loyalty to durant kyrie feels obligated to go along with the choicethis is your mans cool you want him cool you like steve i love stevekyrie emphasizes that even if nash wasnt his first choice hes willing to be supportive even enthusiastic for the sake of unityya know what im saying coolhe repeats cool as a way of downplaying resistance and indicating hes letting it slideas a younger brother im like ok i dont care you want steve to coachkyrie frames himself in a deferential younger sibling role to kd expressing that hes stepping aside and not making a fuss about the decisionsummarykyrie is making it clear that hiring steve nash wasnt his idea or preference but out of respect for kevin durant who endorsed nash he accepted and even supported the decision it shows a mix of diplomacy resignation and loyalty within their relationshipwhy is he even doing this ky is a smart guy but my god he does love to say a lot of stupid and unnecessary shitwe used to think kd hiring his friend and x mvp as his coach was a big deal in brooklynthen lebron made his podcast partner and former nba role player the lakers head coachbro these clips are cringey af steve he wasnt even manifested yet you know not in the physicaljust kind of hovering in the potential but kd speaks his name and suddenly the idea of steve crystallizes and im like alright this is the path now i didnt walk toward it it walked toward us and i dont question the arrival of things that arrive unprovoked thats not my role if steve is the wind today then ill be the leaf its not about agreementits about accepting the unfoldingmaybe im not fluent in kyrie but sounds like hes saying he didnt want steve but wasnt going to fight kd on ithe uses the same technique when arguing the flat earth theory classic kyriewhy waste time say lot word when few word do trickdont ever for any reason do anything to anyone for any reason ever no matter what no matter where or who or who you are with or where you are going or where youve been ever for any reason whatsoever kyrie michael scott irvingtrump techniquekyrie irving in a nutshelllebron kd and nash all listening so hard to understand he committed to going to brooklyn with kd not with playing for steve nashi feel like i have been rick rolled or somethingthats basically kyriemost of them needlessly and some how incorrectly pluralactually he used a lot of words to say i was not committed oh and i didnt like steve nashis it that hard to understand he said he was committed to brooklyn kd said he wasnt but then steve nash got hired and he didnt like that but because kd is the bigger man on the team he rolled with it but was never actually satisfied with the situationbecause he wants to give a bit more insight into the vibes without betraying the confidence of members of that teamwow he could be a political candidate if he wasnt so flaky whats that eminem songwhere you move your lips but nothing comes outbro he believes the earth is flat ofc he is verbose loli feel for whoever has to transcribe these clipshis stephen a interview was a masterclass of the samethese former and current nba players cannot communicate for shityeah hes good at doing thatpar for the course for himand yet all the comments are acting like he said the worst thing imaginablecool ya know what im saying you had that coolwe are all dumber for this experiencetldr i dont like steve nash but durant does so its okkyrie has that effect on peoplewhen you need that word count on a paper and just make up random shityou know a living language just doesnt translate to the digitized world like dead peoples words and worlds youve got to inhabit it is what im saying in the real world coexistent with the lived in reality of its presence and his presence and being present for the infinite aura of another mans soul you cant expect it to leap out of reddit and dunk on you you had to be theremy mans brains bleedin ya knowlol ironically thats not how you spell aneurysmi got you let me sum it uphes not opposed to steve it just wasnt his guy he wasnt pulling for steve hes cool with steve he had no problem with steve steve is cool but he wasnt trying to get steve steve wasnt part of a plan steve was kds guy kyrie loves steve absolutely cool with it no problem with steve if kd wants steve then steve it is but you know that wasnt a group decision it was a kd decision which was cool love kd love steve hope that helpskyrie didnt want nash as the head coach him and kd committed to brooklyn then the nash hire threw the direction off that kyrie wanted to go with it kyrie wanted someone with more playoff experiencedo you know what i am saying most of the times kd talks i dont know what the f hes going on about his conversation is about as deep as his gamekyrie gives off bipolar kanye vibes hopefully he doesnt go full kanyemavs fans about to see how kyrie with contract security actsyeirvinglmao i completely misread this and my eyes widenedgo is an important word in that sentence for the reddit adminsyou knew how it would sound when you typed that out didnt youwhen he retiresid take him over perk for the weeks before he was canceledof course id also take a basketball with glasses and a mustache on over perk but thats just meprobably not no one will touch him with a foot pole dude will just be on his stream that nobody will watchexcept kawhi hes genius level for nba players by saying nothingnailed it every podcast and interview with kyrie kd and lebron specifically has memeworthy moments and headscratching quoteswe realized this a decade agoyou never had the misfortune of having a class with someone on scholarship or protected by the school you feel like billy madison on page with them aroundwhy is this becoming a these people thingthis is a kyrie thingi generally dont like kyrie but i dont think he said anything dumb here kd was clearly throwing everyone else under the bus with his statement and everyone in this sub agreed with that when the initial clip came out kyrie is obviously saying that what kd said is cap and is just trying to say it on a public live stream without completely stirring shithes not dumbmore like an interpretersomeone would describe him as a supportive soni think he means either way whatever kd wants i dont care because i support his choicethose two things arent mutually exclusiveweird thing to say coming from a pacers fan but okbro he is such a nutjobhe legitimately used to be my favorite player when he was on the cavs once he moved to boston and his whole persona kinda came fully into the light with his flat earth bullshit and burning sage and stuff it was pretty over the antivax and antisemitism shit was just turd icing on an insane cake i was already nowhere near anymoredont forget the other day when he said he supported kobes actions in colorado so add pro rape to the listthis is how i feel as a former nets fan kyrie absolutely killed whatever attachment i had to the franchise and ive been better off sincewait who was beating their wifenashthis is the best interpretation of this kyrie clip trying to reach that fivethousand word limit the night before you turn it inits wild how far the adl has fallen in a couple years jonathan greenblatt has said some heinous shit since thenthis post seems to be separated by race or age in terms of understanding what he meant his point seems very clear to me he just didnt code switch you not understanding the terms he used doesnt make him dumb it means you dont understand lol and could work on thatthanks for the summary whats kyrie trying to get to in this clip though not call out who steve or kdid say kyrie is just deflecting from his own failuresexactly yet here we are another kyrie dick riding session because he is rambling a bit lol it is the rnbas group therapy session they gotta have it once in a whilethis sub just hates kyrie its not even a hard clip to understandthese comments are embarrassingdeletedbad idea or not they were very close winning a championship or making the finals without covid and if that happened they would have only built up from theresounds like they both live rent free in your headthe spiritual types like to hide behind a bunch of hocus pocus nonsense so they dont give away how stupid they are year old men with kids need to stop using social media its not that hard to understand what hes sayinguhhh idk about steve being a great coach i think after ime dipped and atkinson left it exposed a lot also great coaches dont get fired and be unable to be scooped up for their abilitiesthat seasonbro not everything is about race why are yall so damn weird sometimes seriouslydont play dumb its not that hard to conceptualize what he meant there of all the things he said thats what you chose to have a hard time understandinghes not saying anything really just word salad or verbal diarrheahe contracted himself in the cliphe just be talking to hear himself push faults else where i just cant take him seriously i know hes great at ball when hes not on his diva shit but i also think hes a team killer imo kyrie thinks the earth is flat bro hes highly regardeddumb words dumb decisions smart guyhes a smart guy but he says stupid shit interesting logic youve got therei think his injury has isolated him a bit and left him too much time to dwell on dramasnaps fingersi chose conspiracy over playing basketball everyone else wanted to play i was listening to anti vax fat hillbillies and crack headssorry lol im pissed if one more kid at my sons school has the measles bc of no vaccine im gonna have to throw their father across the playgroundwell the match lasts about up until the particular inaccuracy particular unusually that should be the ultimate determining factor in about the round experience the heart of a champion margarine hatyou have to be yourself or at least within the confinessay his name and he appearsthis reads like a northernlion quotethis is goldfucking hilarious hes like will and jada smith with a smaller vocabularywhen kd first brought up steve my mentality was like is this guy really conducive to us as a collective to me as an individual like if i start a fire is he gonna be consumed by the conflagration or focused on the reparation you get what im saying is he gonna be sympathetic or sephardic but you know kd is my guy so i trust him complicitly in terms of things of that naturelol sounds like some shit terrence howard would sayam i crazy to think that this makes sense like i get what kyrie is saying here idk if thats an actual quote or not thoughi think thats what hes saying but he doesnt want to outright say that he wasnt with nashthe presentation of it is a bit weird kd says he doesnt feel like everyone committed to the team and kyrie kind of goes and says well it was your choice not mine so is kyrie saying that he wasnt committed why say these thingskyrie is just trying to turn everyone onto the basketball earth conspiracyreal spherical logicis it sea world or see the worldbro if the entire fucking thread doesnt understand what the fuck hes saying yes its hard to understand and makes no sensepeople see kyrie in the title and immediately act like theyve got the reading comprehension of a year old kyries a nut but its really not hard to understand what hes saying here lolthats forgot about drefeels like one of those instances kyrie shouldve used his voice and talked with kd about who they both want to play under instead of deflecting and absolving himself of blame after the factfeels like you just put your own assumptions in therethats not really what he saldhe said kd wanted steve and kyrie was commited to both of them in brooklyn so if you like steve then i love stevebasically if you wanted this i also didkd and kyrie had kenny atkinson the reigning coach of the year fired that led to steve nash miss me with this bullshitbut and im quoting an actual source here which might invalidate all kyrie adjacent opinions he said he didnt carewho gives a f what kyrie wants hes entitled kyrie dont run the teami dont know why i thought kyrie was so clear like hes not giving a speech hes just casually expressing himself i dont know why ppl here in the comments have a hard time understanding what he was trying to converse you are right that was what he meantthe same kyrie that said the team didnt need a coach he got what he wantedi thought he was in a manic episode when he was in brooklynagainlmao hopefully he does that would be entertainingpeople really got lulled into a false sense of security when luka left kyrie became indispensable to the team when he was injured he had nothing but free time when he signed again he secured his last bag from the nbawe were building up to a true kyrie irving psychosis flurry this past year and yet and yet there were still nephews saying we were just being absurd like go back to school kiddo this dude was an antisemitic flat earther antivaxxer nutjob if you thought he was just misunderstood youre the moronits honestly sad how many of us truly believed the propaganda that the ny media was just too mean to kyriekyrie stans might be some of the dumbest ppl on earthyevingyoure right thats confusing we should call it unalivestreami said porking your mom and got banned for daysoutside of reddit people love kyrie so this is pretty delusionalif he controversial then main steam media well love him thats the world we live in controversy and fear drive ratingsstepped out of his comfort zone one time with im a fun guy and that was enough to learn a lessonwhat did lebron do hes just a corny unc hahathese people as in athletes most are pretty fucking stupidi get not wanting to generalize but lets be fair a lot of people seem to only think about players as just that players you dont get to hear much about their thought outside basketball unless they start doing podcasts or answering questions on interviews outside the nba remember when lebron indirectly defended what china was doing a lot of players are honestly kinda wacko but their saving grace is that theyre good at putting a ball in a hoopim willing to bet you are in the same room temp iq rangea supportive son who lost his father figurehe could care less about taking the shot the vaccine shot first round sweeptheyve won as many games in the nba finals as the heat have since lebron took his talents away from south beach so weird thing for a heat fan to saythe real ones just dont care about certain failureskidd the team i was a fan of are the mavsthat threw me for a loop as well until i saw the flair and realized he was talking about the mavshes saying its unfair for kd to say he wasnt committed when he approached kd with the idea of going to bk in the first placefr especially listening kyrie was super clear in this clip but no matter what any kyrie thread in this sub is flooded with ppl hating on him regardless of what he says or what the threads aboutahh now it makes sense why half the country had such a huge problem with obama sbro what lolim sure there are some black people that have no clue what he just said what you gotta say about thata coach is only as good as their staff and with all the turmoil they were still a pretty great team covid and injuries hurt them maybe a more experienced coach couldve kept the guys more in sync and supported kyrie not getting vaxed to show solidarity i think steve really struggled with thatyes yes use the comment that always gets posted has a response to this statement instead of talking about something uncomfortable the man has said and done by his own action everything but the say words im racist to white people but its not about race dont know if you notice or not but if you look outside we got a giant orange rapist pedo of a turd running the whole show right now because people didnt want to vote for a black women i think a lot of whats going on in the world right now is about fucking racebro lolah the ol smart but misunderstood persona mystifyinghonestly whether i agree with that or not per kyrie this is a real issue where otherwise bright people dont get a proper education and fall prey to conspiracy theories propaganda and thinking that doesnt stand up to any real rigor i think for ex its why our elections and fidelity to science facts and expertise has gone the way it has in recent yearsi mean there are plenty of smart people who do stupid thingsnot all that far fetched loli am stevewhere do you live fuckno your not crazy i get it too he basically saying i was riding with what kd wantednah ppl just like to make fun of kyrie cause of the flat earth anti vax stuff hes a smart guy but can be misinformedbeing intentionally obtuse is a redditor signature move i dont think a lot of people doing it is proof of anything other than that fact lol literally just read the words its not hard to understand at allno i think this is just a case of people feigning not being able to understand because they dont like kyrie i dont either its pretty clear kyrie is stating he didnt even know kd wanted steve to coach when they were originally planning the move to brooklyn hence steve wasnt in the play then kyrie despite not necessarily wanted steve went with it because he knew steve was kds guy and he didnt want to mess up their relationship by saying no its why he said if you like it i love itreddit hate trains go so hard they start losing the plot and start acting smartassdumbassbruh yall are acting like he saying this in a nationally syndicated interview its a stream he does everyday for hours talking to likely a bunch of kids he literally spent two minutes on this topic why are we acting like hes crashing out lol he just had a boss he didnt likethis is literally what kyrie said he also mentioned how udoka was on their staff then went to boston a team in their division and it really hurt themif yall took time to watch while clips instead of reading quotes from headlines you would get the full context of what these people are saying any quote taken out of context can be confusingid say one of your max players opinions matters a lot im also not saying i agree or disagree with him i have no idea what nash was like as a coachthis is nba not euroleague stars in fact have a lot of poweri honestly think this was a bit of a cultural barrier for some of the people in this thread lmao i understood what he was saying completely but i could see how the context and delivery felt indecipherable as a black dude this is just how wed get a point across and a lot of whats said is more implicit through tone and expression rather than explicitly especially if youre not trying to burn any bridges like kyries trying not to do hereyou know why we all know the demographics of reddit some genuinely dont know because they are old and or sheltered from other races some get off on pretending like they dont know what someone is saying if they dont speak proper majority of the country is illiterate i am sure the majority lack proper comprehension skills as wellyeah im not saying i agree with what he said but this was pretty clearly aftermath statement of him not agreeing with nash being the coachhaha yeah mental illness is so entertainingits actually astonishing that youll see people on rnba who consider kyrie to be intelligent the guy is a moron and hes just like any other pseudointellectual youll run intomavs should make a move for simmons and offer him another max contract at this pointkyyethereve been a few things that show lebrons intelligence is mostly about basketballthe period of time where he was trying to look smart by always carrying a book with him but whenever he was seen reading he was always at the beginning was one of thosehe constantly needs to remind people how great he is in the words of the great tywin any man who must say i am the king is no true kingit takes a really high iq to play nba basketball at a high level ringswhy are you taking away what we did with bron or what we did with wade chips youre removing for an attempt at a shitty comebackyeah i got you nowserious question though what has kyrie ever done to make you think he is a smart guythere are certainly plenty of people who believe stupid people are smart because theyre able to do fancy dribble movesthe real steve was the steves we steved along the steveamericayeah it seems like hes just talking about how it went from an idea to reality extremely quickly and kyrie felt like he was the one that brought kd to brooklyn and then kd had a lot of influence in bringing steve there even if it wasnt kyries preferencewith respect at some point you cant be considered smart if you allow yourself to be constantly misinformed distinguishing between what is bullshit and what isnt is part of being smarthes just not hes a dumb gullible pseudointellectual crazy handles thoughnotoriously intelligent takes flat earth in anti vax top kekhes a smart guyhe also posted the black israelites jewish secret society movie and never apologized like the dude is repeatedly tricked by online conspiracies hes your facebook aunt but good at basketballpeople rightly make fun of him for platforming stupid ass ideas to his massive fan base thats not a smart person thing to dohes just talking casually on a stream which is fine people are joking because its a dumb quote to use as a titlekyrie steve wasnt even in the play yet but this is your kd mans this is your mansso i gotta support that this is your mans cool you want him coolyou like steve i love steve ya know what im saying cool as a younger brother im like ok i dont care you want steve to coachlmaoboth you and that justin guy above just articulated this better than kyrie because you didnt beat around the bush with fluffy language thats the pointthese people just hating thats what im convinced like hes crazy so im not gonna even pay full attention because he probably just saying some bshe wasnt lolprobably didnt watch the video too which would make sense why they dont get ittbh i dont really think what he said is a big deal i just more think hes got a pattern of talking about it and not being about it and wish hed just be about it morekyrie wanted udoka and a coach that had proven playoff successeveryone here has had a boss they didnt like and expressed it before but since its kyrie he cant do thatdont think you know what literally meanswhy you making it about race bro slol me also being black im reading the comments genuinely wondering how everyone is confused by what kyrie is sayingyea dude also i think a big portion of this sub probably are teenagers so loli think some of it is also kyrie expressing his thoughts which means a lot of people will call it crazy no matter what hes absolutely said stuff i dont agree with but theres nothing wrong with him transparently telling his side of this situation and it all makes sensehey like it or not right or wrong it is entertaining but kyries not bipolar hes just a delusional narcissistthat quotes cool and then you remember the character who said it died on the shitter due to his own arrogance after paying for the same whore he made fun of his son for trying to save lolchris eubank said he was king all the time then just kept knocking people outwhen tom brady or kobe did it killer mentalitythat may be cringe but it doesnt make him an idiotlmaooolive in whatever era you need to feel betteror talk in a mic or be a politician or be movie star or play an instrument i cant speak for any other country but in the us we hold near to us this idea that our entertainers might have some redeeming qualities outside of their profession sometimes its true and sometimes its untruemaximum steves achieved steveceptionyeah if you watched the actual livestream it just sounded like he was toeing the line not wanting to offend anybody to badly but the spirit of what he was saying wasnt hard to understand if kd had done the same during the mtg episode kyrie wouldnt even have done this stream however this is just his side of the events and he took zero accountability for his actions alienating hardenudoka was an assistant for the spurs for a long time nashs coaching experience was being a consultant for the warriors for a few yearsyoure severely underrating udokas experience he had up until that point and hes very clearly been a good head coach in both boston and houston so kyrie was right if this is who he wanted to have the positionthis was simply one clip from a longer stream of him expressing his side of his nets tenure i do know what he literally said because i watched itfeel like you literally just made your own assumptions therelol i was fighting myself so hard to not make the comment initially but it was too obvious where the confusion was coming fromhaha did you watch the video though i was under the impression some people here dint which then if you only read the quote it would be hard to understand for sureits corny when they do it as wellthats why bill russel is the goati dont actually remember kobe ever proclaiming hes the goat just obsessed with winning correct me if im wrong thoughno one mentioned the word idiot are you jousting with yourself yea people tend to associate someone being popular with them being smart intelligent in all other area and aspects of life and thats not true there are countless examples of famous people doing dumb shit in the past and many more to come in the futurestevesteve between the leaves hed have been right if he wouldve wanted just about anyone else kyries own antics aside nash was a horrible coachkyrie said these exact things on the stream are you rage baitingno one mentioned the word idiotthese guys talk too much and eventually show theyre idiotsnash really wasnt a horrible coach though his xs and os were really inspired he trusted his players more than the average coach was at that point and he wasnt ashamed to strip the playbook down in the playoffs and say ok you scouted our pet actions harden and kyrie are limitedmia but can you actually prove that you can stop kd coming off a screen feet from the rimthe issue in brooklyn was kyrie durant and harden played more games together than you and i havei guess he doesnt read as frequently as his name suggests',\n",
       " 'lakers should switch to solid black jerseys for maximum slimming effectwhat the fuck are they not feeding this manplease nico say some more shit lets see his final formi appreciate that this isnt the point of the post but i went to the allstar game practice last year and hes amazingly good at halfcourt shots a few of them were messing around and he just kept hitting he took a few where the arc practically went up to the jumbotron and still hit it was the most impressive part of allstar weekendive been a luka weight watcher for his entire career previously a chandler parsons weight watcher this is the most svelte ive seen himcan we start the season liketomorrowawesome pics great size look thick solid tight keep us all posted on your continued progress with any new progress pics or vid clips show us what you got man wanna see how freakin huge solid thick and tight you can get thanks for the motivationluka weight watching continuesok actually why does he look like this this must be the slimmest hes been since his rookie season im not even exaggeratingpersonally ive never bought into the luka getting in shape hype but he looks so thin here and the season doesnt start for another two monthscant wait for eurobasket to startwho knew all it would take was to be traded berated and underestimated for him to lose weightnico done gave this man an eating disorderruh rohyall nerds chanting ben simmons workout video are gonna be real quiet next seasoni think luka is going to surprise some people next year i thought he was clearly the second best player in the nba a couple years ago and last season was such an outlier for him for so many reasons longest time missed to injury traded that i think taking it as the norm is a little bit insane seeing him fall to usually behind guys like tatum is such an overreaction to me i wont be surprised if hes consensus the second best player next year and contending with jokic for number one that said while this does look the slimmest hes been since these videos are always a bit hard to gauge objectively itd be great if we could just see a head on shirtless photo with neutral lighting to comparecant wait for him to show fucko harrison why hes a dumbass next seasonlukas revenge arc has beguntravelim ready for angry luka this seasoni wanna see if luka can still play bully ball in the paint at his current physique that is my biggest concern for luka dropping significant weighthe looks normal he cant go back to his rookie body because he is a grown man what he does need to do to look builtripped is to workout and train to be more athletic it would help his defense tremendously but his baseline is still hofoh yall done fucked uplebron gave him some of that thang teague was talking aboutdamn zaddy that is alloff his right footthats a fiba ballluka is getting ready for the eurobasket in augustdamn he actually looks like a fucking athlete nowluka ozempithick solid and tightdude he legit looks skinny asf tf he

fuckload of effort into getting celebrities and top athletes in peak formive been told by nico harrison fan accounts that hes fat and a liability for an nba teams futurenico after luka wins a

concerned were losing bullyball luka his game greatly benefits from being healthier and lighter overall but hell also need to adjust his game and the stress of banging bodies will impact him more than he expectslook luka a burgerhonestly league fuckedthe real question is why blow out at allthe leaving texas effectall he knowsis skinny luka off season videos the new ben simmons hitting threes in the off season videos damn we really about to get a dedicated luka season this all has to be motivated by nicomvp season incomingive seen this since his nd yesr but dude really looks and feels different this timeread it too fast thought it said looking fat and skinny which i would be even more impressed byskinny luka and monk wemby are about to make this an insane seasonthis man is about to fuck us all upwhen i was scrolling past this i only saw the first part of the title which was honestly really funny wtf is this video gonna be type thingdamn everything was bigger in texasthe looking skinny editorializing is very tiring lets just add it to every fucking luka headline cuz why nothell be fat as hell by the time the season startshow do dallas fans feel about this i mean he clearly is working a lot harder on his body now than at any time he was with the mavschef luka checking inbro yall reddit mfs are obsessed with this mans weight cringe afwow looking goodnice balli wish cutting booze or soda would result in pounds dropped instead i have to actually diet lolppls obsession with his weight is cray he was never even fatwonder if he willhave durabilityi guess him casually draining a half court shot is unremarkable to us these daysthe ease at which these guys shoot from half court is artful been playing ball my whole life and can shoot nearly as long but this is crazyliving in dallas vs living in lahonestly he looks normal fuck offi mean dude is its taking him weeks to look good again on some of that lebron magic juicei hope his wife is taking care of him because if she wont i will this sub is turning into a era tabloid i could not give less of a fuck what a players body looks like in julysomehow he is going to find a way to get fat againmen of the world hear meremove soda and alcohol from your lifeyou do not need itit will immediately add years to your lifelets get after it you weaklingsi have played these games beforechunky luka gonna be backwhen you leave america you can eat all the fooddessert you desire elsewhere and one would still lose weight not surprised at all luka was skinny on madrid comes to america and gets heavycan people stop with the luka body posts its just weird nowhell it was always weirdthats dude walks like he has a bad back hips or pelvis problemasnow he only needs to get rid of leclownamerican food is mostly gmo shit the food quality overseas is way better especially in europe i feel like he needs to watch what he eats when he comes backwhy are we applauding a professional athlete for being in shape shouldnt that be the normi can never comprehend how these athletes are overweight or struggle to be fit id bet of us on this platform are overweight and unhealthy because we all work grueling jobs that leave us no time energy money or desire to cook a healthy meal times a day and exercise adequately meanwhile these guys have quite literally every resource at hand chefs trainers nutritionists their only job is to be the top in healthfitness is it just pure negligencehe isnt resigning in la no chance he wants to pay taxes plus be last in the west once lebron retires next yearas someone whose mental health and life revolves around fitness and maintaining fitness it blows me away that athletes who have unlimited resources arent able to be fit for their jobs good for luka for getting in shape but when i see nba players who just shit on their body when they could have personal trainers physio at their whim private chefs and nutritional experts who could maximise food intake and make it tasty i would kill for those resourceshes on the hollywood diet vomiting x a dayooooo oooo ooo ozempicluka is going to play the next month in eurobasket and still somehow come back week one in october without these gains it was writtengonna be even easier to get around this guyliterally any time the ball goes off screen i automatically assume its fakecant wait for the luka lost too much weight and is getting bullied in the post he better bulk up next offseason postsdoing blow and partying all summercan luka please dunk againif this is just all hype imma remember it next year when i see another luka off season physique videothe epitome of wed still be together if you just listened and now your new gf will reap all the benefits of the very thing i asked fordamnhe does look fit i guess nico provided that extra motivation maybe he has lukas best interest in mind after alli honestly think he hasnt lost any weight that lakers jersey just was super unflattering so he looked super fat in it compared to the mavs jersey yall will be saying he put the weight back on when you see him back in it in preseasonhe looks barely different yall exagerateskinny is a pretty big overstatement herewait till hes back on the roaddoes he need to relearn his shots without the drag effect of armpit fatim not sure what to feelim a luka fan but see flair life is never easymaybe hell get back on defense for once i hate himthe sooner people realize the offseason was the time we saw a slim luka every year of his career the sooner these posts will cease to exist yes he is in good shape now just wait until hes on the road and traveling almost every night for months and not chilling with an offseason training list to go off ofso the mavs were right and he could have done that whenever he wanted but he didnt feel like it the trade is still bs because they got nothing in return but i do agree it was a good thing to ship him outsoi get the whole narrative about luka being pissed at and motivated by nico trading him and slandering him a bunch post trade but why did it take that for him to get in good shape again like why not just keep yourself in good shape in the place you professed to love and wanted to win atthere is no excuses for a professional athlete to not being in great shapeif skinny luka succeeds nico was rightif skinny luka fails nico was wrongif luka becomes fat and fails nico was rightif luka becomes far and succeeds nico was wrongit was his own doing now dallas trading him doesnt seem to crazy even he had to take accountability and look in the mirror and realize how out of shape he wasall these skinny luka videos prove niko was rightnot saying hes not fit but you can tell thats some camera angle worklukazempiccocaines a helluva drugthis dude is still tubby looking nglskinny luka is the new ben simmons shootingits every offseason with this dude losing weight the real question is what the fuck is he consuming during the seasonhe is still a fat boy at heart give luka week and he will be fatfat wearing a girdlehis knees already look shotso he can shoot a ball without whipping his neck back huh who knewluke wins mvp he needs to thank nicolol luka was so damn fat people think this is skinnynico was right he doesnt get motivated without nico dragging himstill wont winnot sure how you all can tell how slim he is in the black tank and he looks

enough to make any man lose lbsbbq in cali sucksedit i live therehere all our bbq is mid at best and insanely expensiveif nico keeps talking shit luka is gonna show up on opening night looking like jack skellingtoni love the profile picmavs would have to beat the lakers his words have no more weight as when he criticized him after the trade nicos mavs would have to beat the lakers in the playoffs final form requires sacrificenico see i saved fattys lifeoh this is just his casual form hes yet to show his super balkan or godi am all in on an absolutely shredded luka piling up mvps bonus points if the lakers knock the mavs out of the playoffsyou think theres internal strife about lebrons future turns out hes letting luka in on his training regimentit shouldnt take nico talking shit for luka to not come into the season out of shapeand all it took was the embarrassment of the worst trade in nba history lolyeah this is legit until now at least this is the skinniest hes been since his sophomore yearthis was luka in someone who never watched chandler parsons weight posthouston whats the scoop hereok andy reiddo you only scout white fattieshonestly he should be expected to win mvp this year jokic is understandable but no idea why people are putting shai over himthis guy needs to be in the body shaming hall of famebullshit you have been most laker stanboys knew nothing about this guy until he was stolen in the middle of the nightthis is literally summer luka every yearwait chandler parsons put on weightim loving this neardaily luka fitness updatessince his rookie year hes crazy fityeah this is even better than his stairs running summer i just hope he stays healthy he usually gains weight when the inseason injuries kick inmavs fan here if he wasnt willing to do this in dallas then i accept that this is basically what was asked of him for several years and it never happened im glad hes finally fully committedweird how suddenly lakers fans have always cared about lukanot soon enough yesterday i wanna see our bench and new coach how the performas a sixersblazers fan can we actually just wait a year and maybe do the season but like a couple weeks on couple weeks offedit im currently making a dollar vegetable board so embiid can ramp upyall only have to wait more months buddy hes fucking built too thick and man made you can tell hes sculpted because you can see it thru the shorts his fucking vice grip thighs suffocating thighs rock hard thighs piping hot thighs great arms great abs a stocky chest love the progress his body has made throughout his youth and now as a willing eager adultwhat are we talking about herecute tho built good howsveltareyounoware theveinsbulgingarethe absvisibleibetyour amazing agilityisready eruptletmeknow markthis is the first comment without la or lakers flairbase on the video there isnt much weight left to watchall the zion weight watchers jumped shipthe wnba will not achieve equality until the media and fans relentlessly hound a star player about her weightrelevant need him to dunk on nico where he goesprobably just eating way cleaner and noa lot less alcohol theres almost no reason for most professional athletes to be overweightunless intentional like lineman with how many calories they burn hes how tall and exercising how many hours a day he can eat a ton and just break evenhes never been that slim or lean but last season was the first time that his weight really impacted his game zero defense and nonstop injuries from all the fat he had on him probably motivated him this offseason it also helps that lebron whos one of the best athletes ever is his teammatenot like he was ben simmons before that he was st team allnba every year from his nd year until last year where he got injured arguably had an mvp season in add in some low self esteempublicly attacking his character and shaming him definitely did some mental damage i still cant believe the mavericks front office stooped that low to crucify a player that kept your franchise above water for seasonslmaoi legit havent seen him this thin since his rookie season just pray for health this year we might be seeing some special shitthey really think theyre doing something lmaooogonna have to wait for his in season conditioning and diet tbh weve seen him lose some weight for slovenia beforethis happens every year my friendluka is going for mvp taking no prisoners next yearhis performance is always good so this never really means much if he stays healthy all year then well really seei think almost everyone had him as or in the league in when he finished rd in mvp last season was just horrible the calf injury missed an entire month of basketball and betrayed by the franchise he kept afloat for years this upcoming year will be his revenge year luka is not the player you want to piss off he likes to hold grudges and make people pay for their wordsthis is going to be like goku after the ankle and wrist weights come offif he loses points per game off that but staves off injury and keeps his stamina up for playing min a game to not get cooked in the th he will be finei never understood mavs fans who would always counter with this year luka was still extremely effectivei mean he could retire tomorrow and he is a hofhe doesnt need to be visible abs ripped etc but he needs to get to jokic ratios where hes thick enough to abuse defenders in the post but can push tempo without getting gasseddefense is more about effort this man is fully capable of playing d he just doesnt want to lmaobe on the lookout for an unmarked black car with big burly men in black suits coming to have some words with you for that comment ggx the goatctrlf skinny to find the sane person in this thread a lb man cannot be skinnyin the pink pony clubaerokits athletics its like half about their bodiesdoesnt look like that here he got musclehow dumb are youveryless about how much someone drinks at any given time and more about having done it for a very long timethe damage i guess that adds upthats not hard to do it just has to bounce a few timeswhatever he is doing is workinghahahaaaaaaadont these players have personal chefstbf their job is to win games models and bodybuilders are the ones whose job is to look good not perform well in a sportoh lord man what is the point of projecting onto these guys like what hes pretty good at basketball man him being a little chubby its not a part of our tragedy you are not working out as much as luka doncic if you didnt have to work and hes in plenty shape to command the position hes in trade or no trade hes good at his job and he is in the top of fitness pretty firmly just by being in the nba let alone playing mins for years negligence hahafor real i work a hard desk job but my hobby is to stay fit and it actually costs me money but i still do it cant comprehend getting paid millions and all of those resources and not doing itcool browhat kind of mentality is that youre already into fitness they work out just as much if not more than you even the ones who shit on their bodyis there a scarcity of access to fitness idk why id be criticizing an nba player thats a way bigger issueweird copiumhes always looked like a regular dude he now just looks like a skinner regular dudeleave d glasses on every fans seat but in reality they are slimming glassesbelievablei cut out of my beer drinking and have lost lbs so far since the beginning of the year shooting for morelike andys explanation for getting into shape on parks and recvodka sodas onlyi thought it was homemade arnold palmersi started drinking one beer a night and gained like pounds in a month after i realized that immediately decided to stopi mean calories wise a single beer isnt crazy but man does your body decide to keep those carbsso thats what i have been doing wrong all this timethatll do it not gonna lienever doubt michael finleyfrom i cut liquid calories grew inches and lost pounds sugar is no fucking jokeedit except a glass of milk with breakfast and dinnerwhat no lemonade does to a mfthats it im stopping on sundayprobably switched from beer to liquoroh hell naw they just got him switching over to those cali gluten free beers with g carbsi hope this was a reference to parks and rec because that was probably one of the best jokes in that seriesall he needs is the stress of a close finals series i dropped like lbs by the time game rolled around back up like lbs so fardefinitely loli dont think he has cut the beer yet my friend hahahahonestly this is possible i noticed the next door neighbour had lost a lot of weight and i asked him about it in addition to walking a bit more at his job he said he stopped drinking beers when he got homelike chris pratt on parks recs when he was shooting guards of the galaxy in london at the time and suddenly got super rippedthose sweet roadhog hooks are pure fuelbro went from shopping at heb to shopping at erehwonobvious answerleague

you dont speak for the whole statebesides luka isnt even in lawhat going from texas bbq to korean bbq does to a manhes gonna get that tom brady face liposuctionbullying an immigrant into developing an eating disorder smh my headout of shape luka averaged and dragged his team to the finals on a bleeding knee be for realim surprised you didnt get fouled on the way to making this commentimagine averaging and people still calling you out of shape id pray he wasnt out of shape if hes already put up far better numbers than the current mvp while hes out of shapenico not only gave lakers a gift he also pushed hard motivating luka after he got traded you guys are being fooled hes gonna look the same in uniform this guy did not lose much weight look at his arms and upper body this dude is not in impressive shapeit says a lot about lukas normal work ethic and conditioning that people in this thread are praising him to this degree for how he looks in the vidguess what he did the next seasoni swear this happens every single year and people every year are like best hes ever looked hes serious this time only for him to be chubby luka starting the seasonmaybe the change in scenary does have a big impact on his conditioning and weight but he looks like this almost every year when hes in europeis doncic reverse eden hazard hazard would come back after summer chonky but hed lose the weight during the season from playing games and would usually be the most fit towards the end of the seasonhe really only gets in shape for intl ball he dgaf about the nba its just reps for when he has to carry slovenia on his back every summer his olympic run doesnt get talked about enoughyes this is the annual ben simmons can shoot post in physical formgoogle rick carlisle chandler parsons for the original weight watchersyeamaybe because shai just won mvp and finals mvp and will once again be on one of the best teams in the leagueagree or not no idea why is stupid as hell its quite obvious whyyou seriously have no idea why someone might put the dude who literally just won mvp finals mvp and a scoring title at the head of their mvp ballot you seriously cant wrap your head around thatthis gotta be ragebaitshai aint even peaked yet imonot hard to imagine whybecause shai had a better seasonman this jokic glazing is out of control sga led his team to wins missing his nd best playerthe odds arent great and hes not in the league anymore but i think its furkans yearprobably because hes a better player and is coming off one of the best individual seasons in league historylakers likely wont win enough games unfortunatelyim a luka stanboy lukas a laker simple mathdude was averaging games per year and pts per game maybe if the mavs showed more commitment to building a better team around himweird that former mavs fans would jump ship after gm malpractice a god awful ownership group and constant slandering of their former star playerim so starved for basketball definitely gonna be watching all the eurobasket gamesyour team looks great ngli support this ideagod damn it luka is insane its almost unbelievable his control at the free throw line his traps splashing threes off the catch his lats his biceps his completely fucking erect spine leading on a rope to his neck and perfectly sculpted head you want to talk about bilateral symmetry really luka will show you your fucking bilateral symmetry this dude will take it hard to the rack on you finish through contact with the strongest thickest most virile body on the court spinning to the rim jamming the rock home shimmering like whitest pearl on the court groin bulging like a hidden gemstone splashing threes resurfacing feelings long denied directing traffic dancing with the ball like a ballerina on point rock hard quads peeking through a skirt of silk and tool ill kill myself if my wife ever unearths my secret hitting gorgeous middiesluka doncic god damn you and your glistening porcelain skin game recognize gamewhats crazy is i actually took this comment seriously until i got to rock hard thighs and burst out laughing copypastanandos chicken selection you even lift brosarcasm my friend sarcasmthere is weight but its just muscle nowship sanki think health played a big part too he was basically constantly injured from around april until february cause the mavs never really gave him time off to heal until he refused to rush backits not the fat that led to injuries he just gained weight because he was injured he had those calf problems since the end of the seasonthats what scares me if he locks in physically and is even better than he used to beima need you to search luka and skinny on this sub rqyoull find skinny luka off season posts from years agonever seen him this skinny since his rookie yeartruth hes an amazing players plays against comp like its a church leagueluka does that all day we are talking about defense rotation staying in front of guards weak side help going over screens his body needs to be equipped imo for a change to be evidentjokic is a big man and luka is a pg there is no reason why luka shouldve ever looked like he did last year he doesnt need to be some specific weight to be able to play in the post jalen brunson plays in the post and he is not looking like lukasga also will play in the post to get to his mid range shots sga is skinny as hellpart of it is stamina players will outright say that they cant play hard on both ends because its too taxingit has absolutely been connected to his fitness level which is also always related to how much effort a player can exert in the pastu can have effort and still be terrible especially guarding nba players just like offense is about effort u still need to train agility drills hip mobility reaction time and studying film i dont think effort does much against curry running around screens for a corner hed be gassed if he put effort on d the better shape hes in the less he has to conserve his energy on ddisagree he was overweight and felt like he was stuck in the mud especially in the th quarterleboogeyman gonna send the lemafia on memore about what their bodies can do im just tired of everyone online trying to sound like a nutritionisttrue most people watch basketball for the bodiesoh yeah wellppl still take that fact and become weirdos about ityeah and were not getting in nba shape even without jobs its delusion its just i wish i had more money nothing to do with his weight havent we seen how hes performed most of his careerthanks man hahhaha omg then you cant even see wemby on the courti legit fixed my blood sugar just by quit drinking beer i believe thats what happened you could see it in his cheeks he loves his beer source man who loves his beernice i stopped drinking years ago started working out a handful of times a week and lost around i did that with pepsi dropped lbs super quick trying to work on cutting my beer in take especially during the weekdays good job manproud of u man keep it uphell ya brother cheers from the snackshey man thats awesome do you drink still if so what did you find to be a good replacementdamnit i was planning on going on a diet to lose weight by eating a whole lot less and just drinking a lot more beer instead dont ruin my plansyoure wild for this one calories in calories out congrats on the weight loss sincerely but its just about the calories youre putting in vs the calories youre putting out cutting beer significantly reduced your calories ini am a recovering alcoholic would drink nearly beers a year i never gained or lost a pound still lbs soak in wet crazy stuffhow much beer were you drinking haha i know rightabsolute chad of a lore headwho wants some arnie palmiesseriously i read on one of the threads that he had an unlimited supply and was just feasting off them theyre delicious but that sugar intake even if youre a world class athlete will pudgy you the fuck upsorry bro but one beer a night will not do this you probably just ate like shitif it was truly beer chances are a lot of that was water weight a beer only has like calories on the very high end so it was probably more like lbs of fat and the rest water weight that said no reason to drink liquid calories so good job stoppinglol na man calories in calories out thats it when it comes to weight gainloss one beer a night didnt cause you to gain fucking pounds in one month your eating dideat clen tren hard anavar give upfood and eating habits of europeans are in general more healthy than those of the us especially the american south dont think thats controversialkbbq is awesome probably a lot less fat butter and salt in itkbbq slapsedit im getting deja vu im pretty sure someone said the exact same joke under a luka thread and i responded that kbbq was good like a month agoim surprised jokic didnt jump on his back or elbow him eitheris it possible for you luka stans to understand that him being in shape isnt about him putting but about being capable of doing the absolute bare minimum on defense what good is if youre a turnstile on defensenico should get a statue in laas a mavs fan i told my family when we heard i hope this at least gives him tons of motivation and pushes him over that mvp edge hes been on fingers crossed as a luka fandude his face has lost kg alonei am quite literally looking at his arms and upper body compared to photos of him with the lakers last season and hes definitely made some genuine cutshes never been toned even when he was much thinner a few years ago but he clearly has lost weight since the seasontrippin this isnt the same luka from even dallas finals run loli can understand your point of not praising someone getting in shape for their job but he lost pounds since the trade if not more he might put that weight back during the season he might not but lets nots spew dogshit around for the sake of hatingare you blind he is quite obviously skinniernew hoodie melo ben shooting s has droppedthis is an every season occurrence but now he plays for the lakers its higher profilefuck off nicoyou do know genetics do play a factor in how one looks white europeans arent know to look shredded and or muscular lolim somewhere in the middle his arms look skinnier and slightly more toned than where he was before but still not impressive for an nba athletedude he lost like lbs of face fatthis is so dumb his face alone is the skinniest its been since he entered the league looking at what it looks like now compared to the last couple seasons it looked like he was stung by a beelosing weight doesnt mean looking jacked theyre two entirely different things yeah hes not jacked and muscly like others but hes for sure lost plenty of weighthe is skinnier than chet wtf are you talking about manate chicken mcnuggets on one sittinggot fat again only for him to be chubby luka starting the seasonending the season rarely does luka come into the season fat the problem is he picks up lower body injuries at the start and by december hes mister baloonyep any mavs fan here knows the drilli love luka and still hate this trade with all my being but i dont think luka will ever changeits so crazy how dismissive this sub is of shai bro had one of the best individual seasons ever and people are acting like he hasnt done shit yetwhich is exactly why the award is more likely to go to someone else imo they dont like doing backbacksits wild that there is so much thunder erasure they just won the chip off the back of one of the greatest regular seasons in history all lead by a very deserving mvp wildest one ive seen is people talking about the thunders championship window closing without much successlakers flair means they are probably serious but should be disregarded anywayspeople genuinely forgot how good luka is this take is horrendous cuz aint no way shai is better than luka when both are healthysga is incredible and did indeed come off one of the best guard seasons ever but come on manshai has career triple doubles nowhere near the elite playmaker and offensive juggernaut that luka issgas for sure a better playerif the situation is lukas legs fell off and hes playing on a wheelchair lmaoand if were also ignoring that okcs team is stacked a luxury luka let alone most teams in nba history never hadlolbetter roster our offseason after the finals should be the biggest motivation for luka to get skinny and come to season healthy but no he gained more weight and was a big factor of him getting injured if he didnt wanna get in shape after a sad finals loss he wasnt gonna change maybe he stays this way but he most likely is getting thr weight back after a yearso you agree lakers fans are just now former mavs fanssucks being out so early in the playoffsyou could always watch the wnba lolsame to you need to start smart though and bring ar off the benchluka lebron smart rui ayton thats a solid way starting line up may not be elite defensively but theyre at least average and they dont need to be elite because the offense is so goodis this aiyou didnt stop at suffocating thighsate the shiphe had weight problems way before that this is just coping by peoplethis is from for example does his health have to do with him eating more calories than hes burning players dont gain weight when they tear their achilles and cant run for months why would luka gain weight cuz hes playing through injuriesyou got a guy with goat potential and a good core around him you should be goodbetting against a five straight first team allnba guy is boldwasnt years ago like his best season everhes not going to go over screens lmfao if hes forced to do that something bad has already happened but as long as his perimeter defense on is better the hating will stopthe myth that luka needs weight to play well is so completely ridiculous and fabricated on zero evidence been saying the same ring for a whilethe fittest man in the world wouldnt get past that th moving screeni guess i mean fat athletes bodies do different things than fit ones lebron probably owes the last decade to how he treats his bodyhe will turn in to a stick figuresame for me with soda blood sugar went from almost down to by cutting it out i didnt realize how much sugar is in some of the things we consumemy blood pressure went from systolic being in the s to early si still drink i just dont drink everyday mostly just on the weekends and far less consumption than before beers a year beers every single day damngood job on the recoveryi have a new diet its called cut out all beer and also get an mcu deal with a nutrionist so you can commit of your time to your bodyits christinethprobably right i also live a pretty sedentary life desk job so the extra calories probably just tipped the scales literally a little too muchwere not talking about random run of the mill people though this is a millionaire athlete if he wants to eat processed shit he can do that in whatever country hes inif you replace breakfast with cigarettes you will lose weight its an under appreciated aspect of european fitnessbro you think luka is eating the same things the guy working at walmart isportion sizes are also to blame we have a culture of more is better instead of better quality is betterafter traveling i cant ever finish us size mealstotal meme they just live in much more walkable environments so they burn more caloriesbut youre filling the gap with sojuyeah and x more sugarim a total lurker youre not the only one with deja vu with this comment thread lol i feel it tooim not exactly a jokic fan but the criticism of this incident makes no sensemarcus morris runs up elbows him turns away and everyone gets upset at jokic for retaliating like whatthat was fair game the fuck lol dont elbow tackle someone in the ribs then turn around like its a magic forcefield and you didnt just flagrant fouli watched out of shape luka absolute dismantle the timberwolves who beat what many consider to be the best player of his generation in the round before you did manage to get him back when he has his first injury hit season in his careeri mean i hope you realise as a timberwolves fan that year old luka is better than ant is or ever will be somehow i imagine creative imagination has took over insteadgood enough for him to drag a team to the nba finals before he even hits his prime apparentlythats lbs in for real dude had a double chin last seasonpeople for some reason expect guys like jokic and luka to have the defined muscle of someone like lebronhow do you know exactly how much weight he lostdeletedcasually ignoring he now has the most motivation hes ever had in his lifetheres no guarantees but if hes ever going to do the next step its this seasonamenit hardly looks any different to me put him next to year old lebron and its embarrassing theres no excuse for luka he doesnt care to get in serious shapeand before people go off about how luka doesnt have the genetics to look like lebron that is a bunch of bs aka bro science anyone can have a six pack and super cut arms and broad shoulders has nothing to do with genetics sure maybe you wont have the exact same structure as someone like lebron or iguodala but anyone can get shreddedchet is a tooth pick lol luka is not skinnier than chetyeah just had to take a quick pit stop at the finalslots of people that dont know ball and only get their opinions from second lowlight videos flopping videos and click baiterscurry x giannis x jokic x going back bron did it x twice nash duncan voters have no problem with back to back peat is where they say noboring team fake mvp floppersthe word guard doesnt need to be in your comment thats how historic the season shai just had wasfk it russ is the goat apparently give luka oncic the tripledorshai plays defensewhere luka mvp and finals mvpwhat injuries are weight related againim sure some are lolim not trying to sound like im the ultimate lakers fan i just became one in february after hating them all my life i live in lai hope soif you eat a bunch but burn it through training and games so most of it is burned it becomes a problem when youre injuredhe had calf problems for around months aka he couldnt runand like a tim duncan level good head on his shoulders bro just needs to stay fit and hes gonna be an mvp in yearsim just rooting against a team and a player i dont like tale as old as timei bet against him being in shape last off season too and his straight first team all nbas didnt help himdont ever reply to me with that dumb shit againa man can dreamtruesoda is also terrible for your oral healthever since i started using a scale to weigh out my coffee beans i developed a visual of how much x amount of grams looks like and let me tell you thats one hell of a reality check when you see one serving of something has like grams of sugar and picturing how many scoops of sugar that is then imagining just shoving it in your mouth makes it a lot easier to scale back consumption not completely cause i still have my sweet tooth but a lot less and soda is a big one along with sugary juices if im gonna go ham on sugar its gonna be in the form of a delicious pastry or other baked desertyou mean your ac if your sugar was actually youd be dead homiearent soda like sugar or sth yeah its ridiculous how much sugar is in it ironically the syrup they are cutting out is bad for liver but better for blood sugar spikethank you yeah i was between a day not counting extra on weekends its been a long journey but glad im sober todaytbh also as a regular person it would be absolutely amazing to have half a year where one of those guys gets you into the best shape you could ever dream ofyou get my wifes name rightone of the best parts of that hilarious moviedo i look like his boyfriend who lives with him or whatits not a meme its a mix of thingsamerican urban planning work hours and diet are generally awful across the boardmost european nations dont just have more walkable cities and access to healthier food options they also have a better work life balance which promotes better dietary and living habitsyea tha obesity rate compared to in europe is all due to walkable cities nailed ithell dance off the calories to kpop no big dealluka had a team perfectly tailored to him against the timberwolves and the timberwolves were vastly outcoached its not surprising he dismantled the timberwolves im not sure what any of that has to do with him not being a turnstile on defense for being out of shape you seem butthurt i called out your short sighted view of the problem yikestheres no reason why luka cant have defined muscle like lebron luka would be a much better player if he had the body fat percentage of lebroni said atleast and went very conservative i have eyeswill he ever be insanely in shape will he even retain it who knows the only thing is for sure this man is in better shape than you will ever be and he is being paid more than you ever will in these months alone take a deep breath log off for the night and realize how insane it is to hate on a strangers body on the internet for zero gainits been months since the trade yeah its prolly pounds since end of season and why would you say he cant get into shape when you can see hes in decent shape already it shouldnt be that hard to keep it during the season ofc he reverted back to being fatter each year but after what happened last year you cant even consider the option he stays in shape this year not even a possibilitythats complete nonsense it isnt that hard to generate a lbweek calorie deficit when youre a professional athlete with unlimited time for exercise and a high base metabolic rateluka isnt going to turn into lebron over summer its also unlikely for him to put on muscle while losing weight so its not surprising if his arms are getting smaller too though id rather have a skinnier luka than a more muscular but still fat luka so i think this is progressyou sound like someone who gets all their health advice from liver king and andrew tateyou do realize not everyone has godlike genetics like lebron rightdid he win like the experts said he wouldyoure so much smarter than themsounds familiaryou just eat less since youre not burning as many calories its not rocket sciencewhat does not being able to run have to do with eating more calories than youre burningdamn corny as hell this woulda gotten upvotes if it was about shai lmaowhat the fuck are you talking abouthe played minutes a game for games averaged and led the team to finalsyou are objectively incorrect and your comment is absolutely idioticso is getting hit in the mouth for not minding your own damn businessi joke couldnt help myself with the underhand setupnever liked soda never had a cavitygravimetric cooking volumetric cookingyep looking at the amount of sugar in the nutrition facts and adjusting for the fact that coca cola is just slightly denser than water coca cola is somewhere in the ballpark of sugar by weightproud of ya as someone who lost my dad to alcohol love that youre fixing ityou can just do it yourself though running is free pushups and sit ups are free everyone can find minutes a day to do some body weight exercises and such combined with a good diet and you can get into fantastic shape if you exercise hard most daysits all made of best partsits definitely a factorthe effect walkable cities has on metabolism and smaller portion sizes pretty much everything yeahbecause every accusation you could label at luka doncic even if true which theyre not anywhere near that severity does not disqualify him from being the best player in the leagueif hes unfit what is everyone else doing because doncic is better than anyone in the league currentlythere is a reason lebron is literally a physical anomaly you dont become lebron just from hard work you have to be gifted with abnormal levels of athleticism if it were that easy to just become ripped then everyone in the nba would have massive musclesi mean theres not much people with well defined body like lebron to begin with so theres might be a reason lolpeds broyou are dumb as bricksi went very conservativecontinues to say confidentlyluka lost pounds in monthsits very apparent how little people on reddit know about weight loss what causes it how much weight you can lose in a certain time perioda pound a week cal deficit comes out to pounds over months so that still doesnt hit poundsi was more thinking on the side of losing pounds in months is pretty hard to doand just looking at luka in this vid i do think its absurd to say he lost pounds he would look much different if he lost that much weightyoure right months isnt enough time for him to do a complete transformationbut its what i expected with luka he didnt do any transformation worth talking abouthe looks like a normal dude at la fitness its disappointing he could look a lot more in shape if he were dedicated to the grindnope its reasonable to critique luka for this because hes an nba athlete and is gonna get paid big time i dont just obsess over weight loss for normal people but luka is an athlete and it would benefit him a lot to lose the weightbody fatyou dont need lebron genetics to get shreddedliterally anyone can get shredded if they are given the resources and timeboth of which luka has an abundance of he had months since the season ended dude shouldve been lifting every day and then doing cardio by playing scrimmages and drills if he had been lifting and doing cardio every day since the season ended hed look a lot better than he does in the vidu bumhow is the tax working out for you guys are the experts in the room with us top all time statistical vs team with with most of their starting being put together in feb yeah you better have wonmore smartererifyou are used to eating a certain amount just eating less isnt that simplejfc its not that seriousur a hilarious person bro ur calling my comment objectively incorrect and my idioticbut u do even know when the last off season was was it before or after that season that you mentionedor was it before luka averaged a career low amount of games and was partially traded because of thisthink before you commentthat was some norm macdonald stuff right there lmao i can imagine his shiteating grin after delivering a line like thatthink they mean the extra rest and drugs to make your body heal at a higher pace than its at naturallyyou cant get into that kind of shape with casual exercise and diet you can get into pretty good shape sure but not like that player in the league lol pass me what you smokin bruvlebron is on steroids lets not forget thatyeah literally the only person i can think off the top of head is fucking giannis and hes called the greek freakits significantly easier to lose pounds quickly when youre a giant that needs an ungodly amount of calories everyday just to hit maintenance hes clearly lost noticeable weight he just has zero muscle definitionthats so factually incorrect its hilarious ish pounds in months when you are world class athlete is hardly crazy you could do that as a normal person with a strict but reasonable diet ive done it a few times while not being anorexic lmaoyou can lose that much in a month but it wont all be fat its usually calories vs calories out can be attributed to better eating in lukas casedeletedhe could and should definitely be in better shape at this point in his career though he clearly seemed to lack motivation to do so when hes already making nba st teams and just led his team to the nba finals then what more can be expected of a yothough losing out on a bigger contract getting traded and then having his name dragged through the mud for his poor health choices certainly seemed to shake him upthis truly looks like the st summer hes worked on his body since joining the league and could be a turning point in his career whether this continues or not only time will tellyou should contact his team and let him know im sure they could use a genius like youwe got a ring out of itthen why did all of this sub and the analysts say mavs in or it really is that easy especially when youre in your mids and paid hundreds of million dollars to hoop and have a multibillion dollar franchise providing you with trainers and nutritionists no other star player in the league gains weight because theyre injured its a bullshit excuseyes i do know that read the comment chain again you literally said all nbas didnt matter when he took his team to the finals in one of those years so it did matter and he was fit you are incorrectlast year he was not fit no one is arguing against that at allthat can help and make you more jacked but most people in this thread are literally just talking about losing weight and getting into decent shape people seriously overestimate the amount of effort you need to get into decent shapethe only thing he smoked in was the full timberwolves pack youre resting the next years if youre lucky on a man half as talented as weve seen throughout their careerswestbrook iguodalapaolo toothis can be known as being skinny fat youre right he has no muscle definition its fine of course for a non professional athlete but for someone like luka he shouldnt be skinny fathe can get away with it and still be a top player and get paid a max contract so fine if he is settling with all that then thats his choicebut if luka got his ass in shape for real like lebron did when he was young luka could be the best player in the leaguewhen did luka grow two inches yeah thats true i was wrong pounds in months though would require a very strict diet and cardio planlosing pounds in a month would be like anorexia and youd be in bed all day cause you wouldnt have any energy to do anything its true if you were really cutting weight hard you could do it in a month but itd be unhealthyi shouldnt have said months is not possible to lose that much cause it is but luka obviously didnt lose anywhere close poundsno athlete with millions of dollars on the line would ever make the choice to take ozempicthey have advisors to tell them not to do something so stupid and dangeroustakes like min of research to find out all the nasty side effects ozempic hassame reason everyone said pacers in nobody liked bostonokcthats just because your team your fanbase and your city overall are extremely unlikable nobody really said that boston wasnt the better team on any given night or that dallas had more talent boston threw out players that could go get an easy every night nobody was beating thaton any given night in the finals out of the top players of the night dallas would have had max dudesyou dont have to reply to me twice i already didnt give a fuck about your opinion the first timesame finals he was getting blown by defensively cuz of how fat he was in shape doesnt meaning playing good literally just look at him play in and he looks fat and slow on both endsdepends where youre starting from and your definition of decent but actually looking like you work out takes a while months at a minimum and realistically closer to a year that is no reason not to start but expectations should remain realistictimberwolves really living rent free in your head arent theybro what you can love paolo but you cant seriously think his body composition is in the same realm as lbj and giannis but if luka got his ass in shape for real like lebron did when he was young luka could be the best player in the leaguebest player in the league right now is a sloppy fat serbiandeletedwhich is what a professional athlete would obviously be on what is your point im not from boston so not liking that city doesnt mean shit to me our team isnt unlikable outside of the fact its the celtics we only have a super team when people wanna down play tatum when we wanted white to be an all star yall said we were nuts but when its time to discredit tatum yall act like hes playing with all nba guys',\n",

contest ever againthats not wembykarl still the goatwemby is just being kind and respectful to a hall of fame he dont give a damn about or probably dont know shit about his personal life away from basketball stop worrying about other grown men personal life as if yours easy perfectwembanyama will make himself enemies in the league kyrie in the making because he thinks he is smarter than everybody elsei was hating on him for his pseudo intellectual takes before but i gotta give him his props hererealistically what would they do even if he wasnt the future of the nbawemby the goat alrive been trying really hard to hate him since he got into the league because hes a good young player on another western conference team and im a shameless hater but he makes it impossible man just nothing hateable about him once he starts beating my team regularly itll be a lot easier thoughi didnt like him at first because hes tall and probably has big pp unlike me but damn hes so likeablesilver hoping and praying cooper is apoliticalbro karl will try to fight emwhy would the nba do shit about this no matter who it wasnice to see a young player not glazing a pedo like so many others who ignored his behavior because he played basketball at a hof levelhe called vegas a dystopia a while back hes going to be dropping marx quotes at the new cba meetingsthis and the vegas commentas a mavs fan imma buy his jersey and indulge in some churro in his honorthanksits reassuring to know weve got someone with a solid moral foundation on our teamfirst player to not give maon his flowerswemby is no different than any other gen z they dont glorify predatorshe doesnt need more heightnot just nba players but most involved in basketball this sick bitch impregnated a kid and the ncaa and nba hid that shit from the public during his playing career because he was good ill never celebrate anything that man ever did on the court i simply act like he doesnt exist fuck malone foreveror will be like brandon jennings and actually get heated at you for bringing it upto be fair malone is irrelevant hes barely in the public eye since he played call out isnt necessary for that bumcuz they are doing sketchy shit toomaybe not fucking kids but they up to somethinwemby and my generation did not grow up watching karl malone and we hear way more about his scandals than what he has done on the courtthat makes me think how similiar republicans and nba are weird gun culture obsess with masculinity shit pray to jesus and no snitching on pedo i find this kinda funny as a foreigner lollets see him keep that energy for kobewhen youre in the public eye you have to ask if you care enough for the attention that will come with saying anything controversial or eye catchingone of the old members of gils arena miko said brandon jennings his gf threatened her after she joked about karl malone that dude got an all time get out of jail passin case others havent realized already the majority of nba players are morons and dont have any real college education and engages in little to no intellectual activities glad to see wemby at least has a fully functioning brain over his shouldersjohn stockton is a shitty person toodeletednow do kobeif kobe was still alive he would probably get sucked up by most active players if not all of themcowardly mfers people even try to sweep the kobe shit under the rug like it didnt happen he didnt snitch on shaq and ruin his marriagehes the only one who has actually read a book and doesnt care for tribal politics he is who we thought jaylen brown wasthats not wemby in the videoreminds me of hulk hogan and wrestlers public opinions of himhes not calling malone out lol but yes this is goodthis dude is the fucking shitnba wembaw embywhy does wemby have to play for the spurshes too likable same with all spurs megastarshes a stormlight archive fan so that means that one of these games were gonna see him swear a radiant ideal and get a burst of powertongtong pfp is also a big wseems like everyday im finding more reason to root for wemby i really hope he puts up a goat resume over his careerthis actually made me a fan of wembys not cowing to the usual nba shtick of giving malone a pass for his garbagewemby the basedi look forward to having lebron vs wemby debates with my son years from nowsuch a change of vibe from very polished yet selectively silent previous nba superstars like broni gotta prepare myself mentally to figure out how to hate him when the spurs get their next dynasty rollingseriously seems like he can do no wrongwill he doing the same thing for kobewe got outjerkedi got to hand it to this younger generation i think its the first time in decades where they are pushing to hold people accountable and not just sweep everything under the ruganother classic wembanyamathe spurs could not have found a better spurs culture fit it seemslooking forward to the onion picking up where they left off with tim duncanhow dare you he learned shaolin kung fu not karatewemby does karate news to mehes the jean girard of intl hoopswith friendship and karate for everyoneeh kills aliens and doesnt afraid of anythingthat i cant give him a high five without a ladderwemby be making seismic waves with his responsehe been my goat welcome aboardthey dont even need to be doing all that whos gonna call them out not posting a karl malone birthday tweetthe timing of the epstein shit is just cant read the room energy did they shout out hulk hogans death toonba dont care if youre a rapist a pedo or a woman beater as long as youre good at putting a ball through the hoophe just made a fan for lifeyeah im not a spurs fan and especially not after fox weaseled his way out of sac but this is a big w for wemby so now ill be rooting for you big manfuck him cant wait for stephen a to go the way of skip bayless and become irrelevantus spurs fan really chose a good year to get really lucky im so pleased this guy is carrying our culturei know what you mean ive been questioning my sexuality since he got drafted by the spurshey karl i hear you like em youngwhat makes houston superior to all the other texas cities it seems like a pretty miserable place from the things ive heard about iton this day we are all wembanyamaoits all of them todayyou bumi only looked for that comment and its so true whatever kobe did its not as bad as malonefor what dat hoe was lyingwhy would we did karl malone apologize like this first i want to apologize directly to the young womaninvolved in this incident i want to apologize to her for my behavior that night and for the consequences she has suffered in the past year although thisyear has been incredibly difficult for me personally i can onlyimagine the pain she has had to endure i also want to apologize toher parents and family members and to my family and friends andsupporters and to the citizens of eagle coloi also want to make it clear that i do not question the motives of this young woman no money has been paid to this woman she has agreed that this statement will not be used against me in the civil case although i truly believe this encounter between us was consensual i recognize now that she did not and does not view thisincident the same way i did after months of reviewing discoverylistening to her attorney and even her testimony in person i now understand how she feels that she did not consent to thisencounterpedophiles buy sneakers toojust promise cheaper eggsyes quite easily tooit all starts with the realization that a whole lot of people are really damn dumb and almost as many are at least a bit crazyif he were still alive probably since hes dead i imagine he will not say anything at all positive or negativekarl malone is infamously known to have statutory raped an underage girl she was he was but since he knows how to handle balls all is forgiven i guess wemby retweeted the video saying lock him up many players today dont acknowledge malone sleeping with a literal child and just continue glazing himi dont think wemby posted to put karl in jail for not signing his jersey raped a year oldstatutory rape of a yearoldthese replies are false she was when she gave birth he impregnated and statutory raped a year oldimpregnated a year oldwhat the hell did we dokarl malone raped and impregnated a teenager in the s and the nba wants everyone to forget so they can promote him moremalone will fight him for talking crazy and shaq at his heart is a cowardright he just reposted itbody said its wemby in the vid but he reposted it so obviously its his reaction as welli agree i searched the comments for someone to point out the person does not look like wemby i was surprised to find you are the only one to mention itas well as looking different the guy doesnt sound like wemby he has an american accent whereas wemby has a french accentkarl malone impregnated a year old when he was and then ignored the child his entire life kid ended up becoming an nfl playerwhen he was he impregnated a year old and abandoned themremovedgiddey got played and lied to the girls family squashed it because theyre so rich it was a shame she was messing with himnot even close plus giddey isnt an all time cheap shot artistthis one right here officer account is days old and almost every comment is defending a different pedoeven if we ignore the pedo stuff hes not even the goat at his own position duncan dirk garnett and arguably giannis and ad have passed him alltimemost dirty pos player of all time maybebruh so you didnt actually click the link huh made this whole rant about the literal opposite of what happened instead of actually checkingftr if youd actually watched the clip youd see that wemby is reposting a comment saying fuck karl malone throw his ass under the jail the post is praising wemby not criticizing himthey say if pedophile is sitting at a table and people pull up and sit with them there are now pedophiles at the table you sir are a pedophileyou know absolutely nothing about this man if you think hes anything like kyrie fucking irving lmfaowembanyama enemy of pedophilesyeah im just not seeing the problemyeah how dare you call out a rapist and a pedophile shut your dumbass upirl shadowban if he wasnt a starask colin kaepernickgive him the steph whistleunrelated but im an old and dont get the sudden shortening of everything is alr alright or already same lets just transfer all that hate to luka and the lakers plenty to hate on therealmost no correlation between height and pp size so however big or small it is it almost definitely looks adorable on his bodyim wembys age and everyone our age just views him as a pedophile we never saw him play really so we mostly know about him from pedophile jokesedit lot of people misunderstanding me here im not saying that him being a good basketball player is an excuse for what he did or that older people who watched him play are all going to not care about it im saying that its not surprising that someone my age wouldnt ignore his behavior cuz hes a hof level guy because we never even witnessed that it would be more surprising for wemby to excuse it whereas with older people its not very surprising as wrong as it is because they witnessed how good he wasnow do kobeeven worse than that theres almost never any celebrities that talk bad about someone else in their field athletes are notoriously bad like nba players glazing kobe and not even ignoring what happened but instead praising how good he played while going through his situation is absolutely absurd to meborn on the same day as wemby and can vouch that both of us think hes a pedo we live in a country where half the voters seem to not care when powerful men abuse underage girls we need more wembysshit you dont have to play basketball at a hof level to get people to ignore your pedophilia you can just shamelessly cheat at golf thats way easiereven a frenchman knows that man is a creepnah i havent seen a young person praise malone all ive ever seen was them calling him a pedoeuro players dont have the same reverence for the old heads its nice to see the kids are alrightlike people do for kanyeremovedor like so many fans and players who keep sucking off a rapistnow if they could stop glazing a rapist i would feel better about our prospects moving forwardwhich makes me wonder if youngsters would gush over kobe when they meet him if he was still alivehe was posting up in front of mao in china lmaoviva la revolucion and fuck karl malone wemby probhes a little french snob and i love him for it desperately chance he says some shit that people arent ready for at some point in his career and catches hell for it thoughvegas does suck horribly now tbf no point in going unless you make figuresif his nickname isnt already the french resistance it needs to bekarl malone karl marx tbf hes rightthe big poletariatvegas is absolutely dystopianrnba book club rec if you a dumbfuck like me but want to actually collect some food for thought about marxs ideas i highly suggest this heavily illustrated booki learned a lot and i was actually impressed by all the math and equations marx and engels used i thought das capital was just a page vibes rant but its a lot more quantitative than that for the opposite perspective i recommend the thomas sowell audiobook as wellive seen him like reels by an instagram page called ccppropaganda lolwhat does a german philosopher have to do with any of thisvegas taking a lot of deserved ls latelythank you for taking the time to learn about our peoplesi know we have a history of shit talking but mavs fans and spurs fans has plenty of reasons to be friendsfuck the rockets thodont look at how some young people voted last electiondude theres so many youtubersstreamers who are total creeps and still have hordes of zoomer fans its ridiculousthe andrew tate generation doesnt glorify predatorsisnt every gen z player a kobe stanits hurting himsame i like to run alltimepast eras myleague files on k sometimes and malone serves time in prison every time the s always look a lot different than irli feel bad for moses that they share a last name and that more people know karli second that motion pedophiles should not get a passthe last couple months have proven that a huge chunk of americans dont care about pedophiliawell said do kobe nextkarma was working over time to prevent karl malone from ever winning a ring especially with that teamthis is honestly my first time hearing about this i had absolutely idea yeah fuck karl malonecontext for people like me who are out of the loophim and stockton being the iconic utah duo is just so painfully on the noseno theyre probably not they just dont want to cause dramathats not a stupid generalization at allfuckin dudes according to mpji doubt literally all of them are but you never hear nba players talk about malone or kobes rapes there is just an unspoken rule there and i dont know that it necessarily means anything about the individual players it is really unfortunate though hopefully wemby will have enough clout to change thatmoney changes people just for most republicans its the idea that someday theyll have a bunch of money even though right now theyre poor as shitdefinitely not a republican but what a weird comment nba doesnt have a gun culture basically every society on earth is obsessed with masculinity america is a christianfounded country and pedophiles who are richpowerfultalented are protected in any major culturewhy not both i think child rape is about as low as you can get maybe thats why bizarremalone actually doesnt receive enough hate from the nba community as a whole so i dont see how its weak to go after him dont you think pedophiles always deserve hate even if they are retired and stay out of the public eye also malone committed much worse crimes than bridges i dont see how the situations are comparable in the slightestany argument that implies you cant care about more than one thing at a time is inherently a badfaith argument and only serves to trap someone in circles without making a real point please do betterhes still beloved by players that was two days agoreposting a video that says he needs to be under the jail is a pretty strong indictment nohey the next star of the league is frenchcrowd booshes tall as fuck and can shootcrowd cheershes on the spurscrowd booshes also a communist monk who called out an nba hofer for being a pedocrowd goes nutsyep didnt have much of an opinion on him coming into the league but hes earning my fandom with statements like thisyou know ballhe seems like a quiet and smart kid that would be fine in life if he werent i dont think he craves the fame or legacy like lebron where everything he does seems calculated where wemby just seems like he wants to learn about things big fan of his personality but i also like jokics personality a lot more than someone like embiidsi wont lie i do be hoping generational talents dont put up goat resumes for the sole reason i dont want my boy steph knocked down in the all time rankings petty af i know but for people like wemby who take public stands like this i make an exception i hope he destroys the leaguejoin us bro lets root for him togetherwemby the basedfurthest from the ground and hes still basedand even brons rare comments were a huge improvement over jordanas an older spurs fan can confirm he just feels like a natural part of the team ecosystemhe learn shaolin kungfu this summer not karatehe just came back from some sabbatical in asia shaved his head and was hanging out with monks or something look at his igdude is converting flair that should hate himthey have reason to yet they insist on continually praising this man i see the tweet fucking yearly and you dont see it for most nba legendsright show me the nba fans that will lose their shit because the nba ignored karl malones birthdayit drives engagement either waythe toronto raptors didthey read the room and thought its good to go since the file isnt being releasedpandering to the elite we got you too look heres a happy birthday to a guy like yallthey arent profiting off of malones image or jersey sales anymore so whats the point like i get theyre greedy evil bastards so theyre happy to ignore current players or all timers like kobe for profit but whats the motive for malone glazingim just afraid of being hurt againshimmy shimmyim finna pass on this body im john stockton i mean karl malone is already implicity in the songhouston is the worst but i hate all the other ones too lmaorape should never be included in a but its not as bad asbetwen this and karl still the goat its not even good baitfound with other peoples semen in her caught bragging about the sex with friends basically sounds iike a woman who was selling pussy and yet people give her sainthood like these women arent looking for a paydayjust found out that its a video of someone else that wemby quoted as a response to karl maloneoh dang never heard thatwasnt that just a teenage romance without any victimwow youre not kiddingcharles barkley who was malones roommate at these times and has always been a deer friend of malone doesnt get this treatmentbro he is already on the esoteric shao lin shit and brags with reading fantasy and playing chess like wembanyama would have gotten the vaccine lol give it a few yearsmore like wembanyama the upvote farmerwhat does shadow ban even meansending someone to the hornets would be a shadowbanhey siri google colin kapernickjokic treatment lmao dude has multiple mvps but they refuse to make him a big public figure and jok is happy for it wouldnt surprise me if wemby has the same mentality dude has a good head on his shoulders and is super humblein this case its already but it can be used for boththey use it for both and its the most annoying fucking thing everim not even a millennial and it kills me text from one of my students alr bet js lmk wn putranslation alright bet just let me know when to pull upor in actual english okay sounds good let me know when i should head overim old enough to have seen him play as a little kid and didnt know about any of it until i was in my s but i genuinely dont understand how thats not the very first big blaring thing that comes to mind when hes discussed at all nowi am much older i saw most of his career and i remember him as dirty playerits true i was at the meeting for people who are wembys age last month and we all agreed unanimously to say thisim surprised kids today even really know about malone i grew up watching malone but he hasnt been relevant for a long time for me the equivelant would be guys from the s like dr j or rick barry and i just know dr j was known to be a great dunker no idea of their personal livesi feel like the next gen will see kobe in that similar light over the player he was the nurse stated that there were several lacerations to the survivors vaginal area and two of the lacerations were cm in length detective winters the consultant detective on the case testified that there were numerous mm lacerations as well the nurse further stated that the injuries were consistent with penetrating genital trauma which is not consistent with consensual sexhe literally tore her body open in multiple places and yet the defense tried to claim it was consensualits already happeningwas gonna say better keep the same energy when he gets asked but props to him for showing where he alingshes no better im a lakers fan because of lebron so i grew up not really caring about kobe i never gave him a pass and no one else should either including lakers fans but that will never happen the kobe good has been immortalized and the bad kobe has been forgotten by soooo many he wouldnt have survived if his behavior happened todayat least kobe theres doubt and its not provenmalone was kobe is a goat you mad yeah you madunfortunately i completely agree with you pedos are getting more exposed today and people are choosing to ignore it because its people in high places being caughtwemby until now has not praised kobe a single time the guys he has praised until now are kd giannis and jokic but that too just pure basketballimagine today if ant was openly in a relationship with a year old or the colorado incident some celebs get idolized and the public forgives them for damn near anything they do no matter how despicable the act i hate societyhey there thats rnbas favorite rapist youre talking aboutchairman wembytheres only one karl m hes down withif he condemns adam silver for saying that he idolized henry kissinger i am going to bathe in wembanyama jerseysas long as he doesnt mockingly touch all the mics while having the modern plague hes not the worsthe aint exactly little dawghe better not be a fan of hatem ben arfa karim benzema sydney govou and franck ribryive never even set foot in the us but i dont think id like to see todays weirdly sanitized vegas i want s vegas it shouldnt be a place where you can take your kidsthe big jacobinseizeunderage girls the means of production upvoted for providing works to both perspectiveskarl marx has a little to do with just about everythingits a joke relating back to the man of the people comment keep upbet a miami fan loving the christian wilkins saga toochew rows chuckbig ol peoplesgen z doesnt glorify predators except when they doya literally the most right wing lurch weve seen in a while from young malesstop the countomg thank you im just gonna delete him i was just avoiding him your solution is way betterwho is karl moodymoses had some issues of his own but karl is way way way worse also moses was a way more accomplished playeras a woman bucks fan this has single handedly completely ruined brandon jennings for lmao wtfthere are a lot of just neutral men in the league but its honestly kind of crazy the ratio of straight up bad people there are in comparison to the good onesbro the comments on that post are fcking disgusting whats wrong with peoplesame reason all these big celebrities that knew r kelly didnt say shit about him sometimes we forget how most sportsentertainment industry are purely politicalyeah i think about of nba players just wanna hoop and enjoy life as a very rich person the other are very loud and love the drama imoa big part of it is that the nba is basically a fraternity and fraternity dudes never say anything bad about each other thats why no nba players will disavow kpj or miles bridges either its kind of a tragedy of the commons situation where no one wants to speak up bc they dont want to be the guy that spoke up which is disappointing because many of the legends of the game bill russell kareem were so special because they also stood for somethingnba players hate drama its well knownmost of them definitely know rapists on a personal level and refuse to do anything about iteveryone knows about kobes shit obviously but honestly i think you vastly overestimate how many people know about malones baggageit was never really much of a big news item even at the time and its an uncomfortable topic and not exactly something that comes up organically in conversation even if someone is aware of it honestly how many young people are even talking about malone at all even in a basketball context so its not really that surprising that it wouldnt spread around as muchive literally never heard anyone talk about the malone stuff irl or anywhere else other than rnbaso when people say why dont players ever call out malone frankly i just dont think many of them are even aware of it not that they would likely call him out even if they did know loli think if you took regular people in a workplace or just in general not denouncing someone as a rapist that clearly is theyd be judged pretty hardwhy are we constantly talking about the greatest shooters then check mateyeah england is known for its refined culture and then you have prince andrewyes it is but most people dont check others retweets i respect for retweeting and saying something but theres a reason he didnt outright tweet out karl malone shouldnt be celebrated hes also a communist monk that wembymlenchon ticket will be running wild in ive seen enough wemby early retirement to run for presidenti actually think hes similar to lebron in that he wants to be truly great fame might not mean much to him but i think legacy doesi feel the closest thing to him that the nbas had in that mindset but with that ability is kareem and jokic also he def puts off that type of characteralthough kareem did movies which i never seeing jokic or wemby doingbeing true to yourself is more important that living up to others expectaitons victor wembanyamasteph gonna be like duncan where as years goes by people will look better at him than they did while he was playingim a raptors fan by birthright but ill be rooting for wemby to do great things whenever hes not against the rapsliterally above all that shitas a non spurs fan i gotta say it feels right yall got him you endured your low years and your leader and soul is in poor health the spurs are the most likeable club and i genuinely hope to see yall in the wcf soon every wemby was kung fu fightingkung fu not karate hahaid add he was doing judo as kid before going to soccer and basketball tooyep he was in the shaolin temple over the summerbrother do u have any idea how big asia isunless we stop watching theyre gonna keep doing itunderstandable duncan never took to my advancesis there actual evidencewho say it bait not every is a moral hero on the internetshe didnt have another mans semen in her the panties she wore to the rape exam the next day had another mans semen and pubic hair she claimed she had grabbed unclean panties to wear the defense claimed it indicated sex with another man between the incident and the examah yes the old well she was a slut excuse that is often used byrapistshes also one of the dirtiest players in ball historylegally shes a victim but she was bragging her ass off on socials he met her in a cub she wasnt supposed to be in and he kept her around just a bad situation to fall into and i dont hold what happened against hi sure hes gonna be embarrassed af for the rest of his lifekarl malone isnt moses malone dumbassthats every user on this sub you wilding if you think being into anime and lord of the rings makes you a conspiracy broah yes reading fantasy playing chess and being interested in oriental philosophies being a dumb antisemitic antivaxer what a take like wembanyama would have gotten the vaccine lolyou should have led with this so i didnt have to bother reading anything else you saidi would bet you the venn diagram of people who have talked about dark matter in their daily life and people who are vaccinated is a perfect circletf is wrong with reading fantasy like wembanyama would have gotten the vaccine lol this is your dunk bro gtfoon reddit it means you can still post and comment as you please but no one else can see them the shadowy part is that youre not told this is happeningwean him off from media exposure nba instagram and reporting has always chosen which stories to include and exclude the news is always interpreted before its reportedhed lag a little and have longer matchmakingor they would do him like they did that guy on the chicago bulls when jordan won one of his championships he gave a note to the president and he was kicked out of the nba after thathe would think hes playing in the nba but literally never get subbed in or even acknowledged as existingthankswill get downvoted for this but not only do i view malone that way i also have not forgotten the real kobe and not this lionization of his actions we hear todayit definitely is thoughi think it was pretty widely accepted that he and stockton were dirty players but dirty players arent always totally unpopular wade is an example of a more modern player who was generally considered dirty and his legacy is still goodnow dirty when malone was playing was different than when wade was playing but still being dirty doesnt mean you cant be popular and fondly rememberedim pretty sure that if it werent for him being a predator malone would be pretty fondly rememberedi mean malone played against jordan in two finals and played with shaq and kobehes rd alltime in points th in rebounds one of the greatest players of all time it would be a lot more odd if kids today didnt know anything about him everyone knows who griffey is or who barry sanders iswhy wouldnt they know about a much more recent nba player that had even greater accomplishments than those guysi dont think so for a few reasons his family has been able to maintain a very good image kobe is immortalized in the city of la kobes shoes still sell out in secondsspoiler they will notdifference is that karl malone played in utah and never won anything kobe won and in la so people will excuse his actions forever just like other popular successful figures wemby would never make this same kind of post about kobe because people would go ballistic on himnah kobe died and that really does make a big differencei dont think so again you are assuming that everyone thinks kobe raped the woman and got away with it there are plenty who dont believe it and plenty who just say they dont knowi mean you just have to read the transcript of kobes police interrogation its pretty clear from his own words that he raped herdo you have a link for that quoteits about fucking time but were a long long way from a relevant nba player making a negative comment about kobe in public thatll be the dayhe wouldnt have survived accusations from a woman who was found with multiple semen samples in her after bragging to friends about her having sex with kobe her bragging would have been all over social mediaif you read the evidence theres really no doubtdeletedshe was but ok or if josh kiddey giddeyfiddler was in a relationship with a year oldthey do love statues for the worst people he is very likely a rapist as well as a pedo which is a fact at the minimum he admitted to having anal sex with a random woman he met in an elevator even though he is portrayed as this amazing husbandchairmanyamachairman wowhe has my support wembyiharry kissingerbut what do you think about his mischievous younger brother hanklol for real right now i could go to fucking paris or something actually cool for the same amount of moneyit shouldnt be a place where you can take your kidsfor someone who hasnt been here you nailed iti wasnt around in the s but even years ago as a poor college kid it was fun in a this place is grosslets have another drink kind of way i would never bring my kids there now im sad to say i have taken them there and they liked it but didnt understand why they couldnt play all the games with the flashing lightsthe terrorlmao incredible nicknamei think its funny that anything that challenges the status quo becomes a derogatory buzz word for right wing leaning people marx was critical of capitalism because of its composition those who controlled the means of production and the workers he said capitalism is unsustainable because of its inherent desire to accumulate wealth even at the expense of human rights if you look at the bigger picture billionaires are fleecing us while we have one of the worst wealth disparities in history in one of the richest countries in the world meanwhile while all the poors point fingers at each other and use buzz words like marx and socialism those things if actually studied would improve the situation for the average personwhats the joke explain it for dummies like myselffor real bro young people aint special they suffer from the same failings as the old and the deadonce i forgot to delete him and he had a couple of great seasons so i just used import player dna and gave charles barkley all his stats and accoladesthe comments section of most social media sites are always gross i used to think it was kids but we all know its just a bunch of fat bald fucks with nothing to live forkind of reminds me of that one italian cyclist who spoke up about the rampant doping going on in cycling back in the sgranted everyone else was doping too but lance armstrong went out of his way to basically destroy this guys reputation and his cycling career while armstrong was eventually revealed to be a colossal piece of shit and cheaterthat cyclists career never recoveredsame reason all these big players fw diddybro we all knew about r kelly even in the s it was public knowledge the videos were online it wasnt some secretdo you know who hates drama the mostshaqthe call is coming from inside the housemakes me think of ben mclemore iirc the story goes he was with robert covington and the woman he would evetually rape roco justleft them alone i find it hard to believe he didnt know what would happen when he leftno you absolutely would not that shit gets a pass all the fucking time or people straight up deny iti think they can rationalize it as causing issues could jeopardize their livelihoods and prevent them from supporting their familiesfriendsextended family im sure most star nba players have like people theyre bankrolling of course this is just an excuse so that they dont have to feel uncomfortable and do the right but hard thingwembinsoumis strange way to misspell wembypoutoui think the difference is lebron wants to be goat and wants all the trappings of being the goatwemby just wants the goat titlehe has said so himself that he wants to be the bestnah lebron still wants the attention portion from as a spoil of greatness remember in when steph was shaping up to be most popular player since jordan and lebron was making kevin love depressed per reddit with his soundbites along with suddenly getting his dms with women leaked loli think kareem is the perfect comp for wemby especially given just how smart and articulate someone like kareem iswemby wouldnt pass up a chance to be part of star wars franchise if they decided to make a spinoff moviedamn what about those who never left the down years fuck we supposed to dodamn i knew it was one of the two loljudo is definitely a little bit closer to karate at leastidk maybe the fact that he lied multiple times in the police interrogation including the very basic question of did you have sex with her that and the multimillion dollar settlement not a great look is it nowya evidence against his accuseryou dont know shit lolsure idc im not the one judging a man off one mistake he made in his lifetime the way you trying to villify him makes me think you have more to hidesounds like cool kids having fun to me tbhi just googled it yeah moses was the roomate but barkley and karl was friends and barkley seeked guidance from malonebut asian esoteric makes you oneyeah because conspiracy theorists have famously zero interest in cern lmaoin reality the majority of people who talk about dark matter and are not physical scientist are complete nutswembanyama should stay away from dan brownit also happens more commonly than you would think casually looking at my shadowbanned posts via external apps it seems the automod mostly bans political stuff trumphillary and recently epstein etc they dont like it when you dig into the details on reddit it means you can still post and comment as you please but no one else can see themirl version would be funny as hell in that itd be the equivalent of the nba absolutely refusing to show his highlights lolwemby could score in a game but nbas official highlight package on youtube would be all luke kornet assistslol low prio queues road games straight against washington more if he gets reported againwas just about to say this the kobe glazing is ridiculous for a rapistthank you he was a pos human imoi remember when kobe won an oscar for one of the shorts the same year as metoo the real kobei have read more on this case than like of the users of here and gone back and forth on it over the years theres not really enough to make a definitive statement either way imo ive personally read the articles testimonies interviews evidence etc people always point to the statement as some tacit admission of guilt but its a statement that was approved by the victim as part of the settlement agreement it doesnt admit to anything other than the circumstances were murky which i think is closer to the truth of what happenedcalling this the real kobe doesnt really sit right as far as i can recall he had no other issues of this mannerdifference is that it was an accusation and the lady had three different sperm samples during a test i think people were divided about what happenedno downvote herethat wasnt rape he copped out to some bs to make it go away it was a shameless media and money grab and he just wanted it goneits also two of the athletes we have the most evidence they did it crazy that kobe still gets away with it hopefully the next generation that doesnt idolize him will treat him as the rapist he wasi wish i could like this more than onethats a good point years from now theres gonna be some lbs dude from argentina or something averaging pts a game taking pot shots at kobe cause no one watches sd clips of nba broadcasts in d to knowdeletedhe was a judge at the dunk contest in the nba are fine with him being part of their image where they absolutely shouldnt bei think thats true in most online places but i dont think that lessonline basketball fans are that aware of malones pedophilia at least from my experienceonline maybe nba and its broadcasters never talk about it and celebrate him im sure theres plenty who dont have a clue and just think of him as a great former playeronline yes go to a sports bar and talk to the average fan who watched basketball in the s and i doubt it gets brought upkinda not at all though anonymous people talking shit on reddit means nothing he still gets his flowers he still gets his pension his statue and his place on all time liststbf most kids probably dont know who barry sanders is from my experience as a teacher griffey barely maybealso difference in evidence of kobe being very likely committed a crime vs karl literally having living proof of his crimei believe kobe did what he was accused of i know karl did what he was accused ofthat specific quote came from this articlebut the underlying testimony about the genital lacerations i first read in one of the depositions or court transcripts i couldnt find the original depositiontranscript quickly earlier thoughwho knows maybe one day rapists will yell kobe while raping their victim instead of kids doing that while chucking up bad shotsfuck the kobe bryantno he wouldnt have survived the colorado incident because he would already be receiving hate for being involved with vanessa when she was still a kid and he was an adult look how much heat giddey just faced and this was worse the colorado incident would be the final straw if it happened today these older players got away with so much because social media didnt exist in their dayexactly but rnba loves to forget this partevery comment i see from you makes you seem more and more like a creep im thankful i dont know you in person my life is so much better for itwhat is the evidence that proves no doubt theni stand corrected but tbf this was like years back even before he came to the nba so maybe he didnt know much about that case and maybe still doesnt know also he is talking about just pure basketball here toodeletedfuckyouve gotta punch me right in my balls now for thathe sure did nail itrobespierre jordanwere seeing it happen right now in this very sportpeople are calling wemby a man of the people karl marx wrote the communist manifesto and das kapital which are basically about the people siezing the means of productionhonestly i swear all the glazing of gen z that they were going to come in and save the millenials and gen x from all the mistakes of the boomers helped no one out we took our eye off the ball and thought everything would be fine and then online manosphere types etc all just waded in and mindfucked everyonei just punish the team who drafted him by editing him to be as short as possible with all ratings and no badgesfilippo simeoniyeah i dont hate lance armstrong for cheating i can forgive that weakness if the person seems to genuinely show remorse the way he treated people that called him out though fuck that guythe most dramament big man of all timeis it whiteyou saw the beautiful game get ready for the disobedient onethe difference is wemby actually reads the booksjoin the spursi dont know anything about settlements but why is it necessarily an admission of guilt i dont think either of those are really conclusive whats much more compelling that you didnt mention is that she had bruises on her kneck according to the wikipedia articleinnocent people dont gotta pay outragebaitoj simpsons was a pretty swell guy until he murdered two peoplepretty sure she was and he was some people get pitchforks and torches over less than thatfrom moses yeah lmao karl and barkley were never on the same team never lived in the same city youre a dumbassedit the first thing that comes up is charles hating on karl you just say anythingwuuutchuck is the og karl malone hater hes always been on the right side of thisbuddhism is one of the largest religions in the world commonplace does not equal esoterici mean who is presidenti was losing my mind at the coverage when he died it was genuinely insaneyoud rather be remembered as a rapist this isnt a very good comeback billion people in the world right now more than of the people currently alive will be forgotten by the world in less than a couple centuries thats life still better than being a rapisthe was very good at basketballas long as you do that or you simply have a sufficiently large pile of money the nba does not care that much about anything else you dopeople really havent paid attention to the literal decades of the nba as an organization constantly signaling that basketball skill and cash rule everything around it ask anyone about this at the next inperson game you go to and youll probably be met with blank staresi literally grew up in utah and people there dont talk about it i didnt find out about it until i was and learned about it by reading his wikipedia people who spend all their time online need to realize that their realities are not always reflected in the real worldyeha thats what i found but couldnt find it anywhere else its not linked in the article either i tried tracing it to the daily beast piece referenced but that site is paywalled tried finding the og court documents but not as fast on my phonefound this pretty seemingly comprehensive archive though was months removed from he was going on i honestly dont see an issue with it people act like he was a pedophile because he wanted her karl malone who impregnated a year old is a pedophilebecause people like you act like people arent capable of making a mistake or redeeming themselves you act like the demons inside arent there i know how demons look i know what my demons are and try to navigate them so i dont hurt others i dont act like im holier than someone else because i can because im sure if we took a microscope and put it on your life you wouldnt be a saint none of us areyoure free to read all the reports ignore whatever you wanti thought that pervert was how sowhich is a good thing no or should billionaires keep hoarding wealth until they can replace us with ai and roboticsthis is hilarious i too have a great distain for him but it reminds me of when a girl i know get pissed at someone irl she makes a sim of them and places them in a doorless housei try to keep parity alive and not screw teams over but have done that in the past as wellyes thank you thats the guys name im sure he feels some level of satisfaction in that he was vindicated but i also know that he would trade it in a heartbeat for his cycling career to have not gone down the path it didit actually really makes me sick because i was so obsessed with this guy back in the s but as the years went by i feel like european diehard cycling fans knew as early as but the americans like me woke up to it closer to his failed comeback in you just knew that there was way too much smoke for there not to be a fire take this with a massive grain of salt since this was written by an exteammate who may or may not still carry resentment but tyler hamilton wrote a book about his career and he talks about armstrong you get the sense that it wasnt enough for armstrong to be a champion he went out of his way and took delight in knocking you down and stomping on your face en route to becoming a championguys like him are just gradea pieces of shit minutes in shambleslying to the policelying to the doctors who inspected herlying about the two men she had sex with after kobe and before seeking a medical examinationfriends ready to testify against her for her behavior before and after meeting with kobefriends ready to testify against that she had previous plans to accuse eminem of rape when he had a concert nearby only reason she didnt get to try this one is she couldnt get a ride to the concertthis definitely sounds like a legitimate accusation and not a witch hunt against another black athlete accused of rape for the money by weaponizing white women tearsas bigger the religion as bigger are the scamming subgroupsbtw its a philosophy not a religionbro why does everything have to be political now sill personally say i didnt know about any of that when he died then again i was barely an nba fan back thenhis mainstream personality was mamba mentality etconly people who perpetuate that are people who themselves need to be holier than thou i dont judge a man who made a mistake and moves to make his life better he was dealing with a harlot out of wedlock and got his repercussions for itwhose the rapist where the chargesthis is just a normal sports thingnfl michael vick after the whole dog fighting fiasco still got signed and played in the nfl so there were teams who couldnt care less of the image that came withthat browns quarterback even all the allegations and charges against him still got paid millions in the nflcfb theres years of situations where the administration or people in power would keep sexual assault or rape on the low for their star playersnot really an nba thing but a sports thing if someone is really good then the people in charge are fine with it until it actually becomes a problemexactly here i am looking at miles bridges woman beating ass still cashing multimillion dollar checks and anthony edwards about to get the biggest contract in nba history while raw dogging thots and even giving karl a run for shittiest dad awardim sure theres other dudes who were very good that would have accepted to be a judge its so unnecessarypeople at the games are more online then we give them credit for at the beginning of the season i went to opening night for the bulls and when i was going to the bathroom i could still know every time josh giddey touched the ball cuz the audience erupted in boos loud enough to hear it from the bathroomfacts cause my dad is years old and has followed basketball since the s about a month ago he mentioned karl malone and then i brought up his pedophilia situation assuming that he already knew about it came to find out that he had no idea about it all this time loli remember sitting at my computer reading a pdf in a legal looking font google does not like to return pdfs on mobile i think they deprioritize documents in the search resultsbecause im sure if we took a microscope and put it on your life you wouldnt be a saintim no saint i also havent raped a woman so i got that going for medeletedive read most of it i dont see no doubtyou do so im literally asking which partspublicly funded stadiums the proliferation of online sports betting advertising and price gouging on ticket sales helping destroy the viewing or spectator experience lastly id suggest the second apron was really a case of very clever colusion by ownership to put downwards pressure on player wagesit doesnt just prevent super teams but will also punish clever roster building as wellive noticed that private equity and arguably nastier money if thats possible is becoming a bigger share of ownership as old school ownership is exiting the league and selling at its peak ultimately that will probably work out poorly for the league and quality of producti dont think the joke is necessarily meant in a negative waygirlbosshey man they wasted their fantasy draft pick on a piece of shit so i still got one of those yellow livestrong wrist bands around somewhere i wore it everywhere as a kidread kobes statement my brother or as i said ragebaitlol dude get out of you were just calling it asian esoteric bs if you know so much about it you should know its not hard to understand so again calling it esoteric and leading to conspiracies is just trolling now carry on lolgenuinely needed that s in that one loland shaqs public persona is big generous guy laughing at chucks jokes but look up the heinous shit he did during his playing days emphasis on shitthe first thing michael phelps should have done when that photo came out was call kobe bryants publicist cuz kobe was accused of rape and all he had to do was settle in court for millions of dollars change his jersey number and win a championship and that soulless town in la couldnt be prouder i just hope that when parents let their kids run around in jerseys they have the decency to say well come on number was the rapist daniel toshremoved i dont need the court to tell me if something happened or not just so you know during kobes settlement he admitted itfirst i want to apologize directly to the young womaninvolved in this incident i want to apologize to her for my behavior that night and for the consequences she has suffered in the past year although thisyear has been incredibly difficult for me personally i can onlyimagine the pain she has had to endure i also want to apologize toher parents and family members and to my family and friends andsupporters and to the citizens of eagle coloi also want to make it clear that i do not question the motivesof this young woman no money has been paid to this woman she hasagreed that this statement will not be used against me in the civilcase although i truly believe this encounter between us wasconsensual i recognize now that she did not and does not view thisincident the same way i did after months of reviewing discoverylistening to her attorney and even her testimony in person i nowunderstand how she feels that she did not consent to thisencounteri issue this statement today fully aware that while one part ofthis case ends today another remains i understand that the civilcase against me will go forward that part of this case will bedecided by and between the parties directly involved in theincident and will no longer be a financial or emotional drain onthe citizens of the state of colorado thats an admission yes he had powerful attorneys who saved his ass using our corrupt legal system but none of that prevents me from forming my opinion from his statementfoh vick actually got punished for what he did so you expected him to never be able to play football again for dog fightingeh being a moron isnt the same as being a pedo or a wife beateryou have to consider that no one knew about malones case until he was finished playing while giddy got hit with public accusations right as he was starting to make a name for himself in the league even after he retired the only real dig on malones character outside of the occasional elbow to isiah thomas jaw was him hitting on vanessa bryant when he was a laker the deadbeat pedo dad stuff didnt start getting circulated online until after that as far as i can tell it started getting reported on years after he retired when demetress bell was heading into the nfl his persona for his entire career in utah was just the black redneck from bumfuck louisiana who went bow hunting and fishing in the off season and rode a harley a black republican in the body of herculesoh sure thing buddy whatever you say huh were talking about karl malone or kobe now see how youre just saying shit to make yourself seem holier than thou makes me believe youre a lot worse than you let on tbhso the working class is paying for it but also getting screwed at the same time and by old school ownership you mean people who actually cared about the success of their business and not just guys in suits trying to maximize profits at all costs sounds like good ol unchecked capitalismi see im guess im preaching to the choir then my mistake i thought it was being used disparagingly im not the sharpest tool in the shed a statement that was part of a cash settlement where he reiterates his position as innocent your literacy level has to be in the depths of hell to think that shows anythingremovedagreed ss are genuinely a necessity now because people really say some stupidass shit they did way back when too but not nearly at the scale they do now not to mention they used to regularly get down voted to hell but whether they do now or not is shaqs public persona is a big whiny baby lol everyone caught on to his bitch ass a while agoi worked the tosh comeback tour a couple of years ago and dude is so god damn quickwitted funny and plays his overly privileged white man schtick so well that i can remember a single best joke because they were all greatwas he not the woman wasnt a prostitute wasnt she found days later with multiple semen samples insidethats not an admission thats him apologizing to the world and the woman about the event thats accountability if he were guilty he would have been charged the evidence was inconsistent and inconclusive i wasnt in the room so im not gonna act like i know exactly what went down in the room i know that after that ordeal kobe lived his life differently and once his daughters were born he lived for them so me judging a man who made a mistake like im holier than thou just makes me less holy its the people who would never be in that position who act like they are above it we dont know how consensual it was until it wasnt we know about her character and his shes the kind of woman to have sex with other men after being saed shes the kind of woman to brag about the ordeal after the fact its the people who act like they cant make mistakes or the ones who judge others harshly who are the irredeemable oneshe also did a ton of work with the humane society and gave talks all over advocating against dog fighting he genuinely seemed remorseful and to regret his part in everything dude definitely paid his duesyesmoron is generous the bigger issue is hes a deadbeat dad who is arguably trying to emotionally manipulate women into getting unwanted abortions still not ad morally reprehensible as being a wife beater or pedo but also worse than just being a moronthats why i specifically said shitty dad lol i know that casting away your seed before its even born isnt as bad as being a pedo or beating women but its literally what karl did with or more of his children including the one he raped a old to conceivedeletedhis position as innocent where he states that hes not sure he got consentbro what are you even on what does this have to do with you saying visiting china and reading fantasy means youre an anti vaccer',\n",
       " 'even at duke i wasnt overly impressed with his basketball skills obviously all the physical attributes are there just whether or not hell properly developi dont care much for summer league performances since theyre not that indicative of success in the league but honestly malauch is not the kind of player youd wanna keep over that pelicans pick that pick could reinvigorate the suns franchise if they were to get lucky and ended up with one of dybantsa peterson or boozerhes and well known as a project lol plus the summer suns didnt have jack shit for guards so as a big that doesnt have great ball handling skills it was hard for him to get the looks he neededwait years lol its the only way to gauge it but of course what would we talk about if players had to have proven themselveslet him play a game dudehollinger also had this to say about the nets new draft picks after watching them play in personbrooklyns draft class four of the nets five firstround picks played in vegas we never saw drake powell and wow this was not goodtwo of the three worstperforming firstrounders by per were nets imports nolan traor and ben saraf while fellow firstrounders danny wolf and egor demin werent much better given that many league observers already had questions about brooklyns choices and strategy on draft night this was not a great kickoffwhile some of these struggles can be written off as shooting variance traor in particular looked overmatched the guard prospect didnt have a single steal or block in his minutes and only shot of from the field in his three games saraf had identical shooting numbers but at least spiked his box score with some promising defense and playmakingone other thing that became obvious while watching these guys try to play together was how poorly they fit with one another all four of the firstrounders who played are guys who need the ball in their hands to be effective but arent particularly threatening from the perimeter that often resulted in situations where somebody like saraf or wolf was in the corner as an alleged floorspacerthe kid has only played basketball for like years and hes a project player give him time before labeling him a bustthe pelicans never had to make their best offer to the suns the pels didnt want maluach and the pels could still work a deal with teams picking after the suns maluach was a good pick at everyone who was available at the th pick has flawsmaluach was drafted as a project thats why they picked up mark williams a move that was clowned on draft day and are retaining richards ive noticed that hollinger gets hater tunnel vision on certain teams and cant help but criticize every move they makeas a basketball novice maluach got noticeably better at duke as the season progressed and with professional coaching i would expect the same here regardless its going to be a long road one that the suns were well aware of when they drafted himgotta love summer league busts hes the suns guard play in summer league was so bad and no one was a victim of that more tha maluach he will be a good lob threat easy when there are guards defenses care about handling the ball he set good screens was a good rim deterrence and was already a solid defender out there and did a lot of the little things pretty well i dont think i have ever seen hollinger say something good about suns players like ins years idk if i have ever seen him say something positive about the sunsi need examples of big men who developed their hands after getting to the nba because as i remember having stone hands is such a deathknell unless you are a generational defensive talentmaluach even for the casual nba viewer understands is a project by any measurementwill his nba career turn out like a thon maker first round th pick who averaged points rebounds his entire nba careeror will his career be more like serge ibaka who had a pretty solid nba careerhard to say it all comes down how he improves via added development and also the fit on his teami honestly quite like maluach seems like a down to earth hard working and good natured kid but it will easily take seasons of development before we start seeing what maluach can truly look like in the nbait may have benefitted him to actually be in houston who drafted him but hes going to have to make the best of his opportunity in phoenixremind me yearsimagine judging player chemistry off this sample size what a joke of an analysishes and going into the year as the backup center were we expecting splitsi think coach ott got his guy and thats all that matters now the focus is on finding a way to get a st round pick in general because the next draft will have a ton of pfs to select frommaluach looked better playing with flagg and knueppel nba players will only make maluach look even bettermaluach will certainly open up room for green and booker to operate and all kickouts will be available for sif im running a team id rather have khaman with a year of nba experience than at least one of the prospects you namedmaluach is all class and has an immensely bright future wherever he ends upmaluachs hands were always a problem and he was never a good defensive rebounder his assists were comically low as duke never trusted him to do anything but dunkhe has upside and taking that many s is a good thing in sl but idk what anyone was expecting right now loli feel like people have way over index on summer league not mattering yeah the raw box score numbers matter very little but the on the court process does still matter and is what you should be looking for does the dude read the court are the step slow with switches can they catch not perfect passes all of that still matters and is worth evaluatinghes him dont worryas a duke fan he plays soft on the glass if you watch closely he actually doesnt box out at all which is confusing to me cuz youd expect duke coaches to be on his ass for it but nah it continued into the tournament doesnt hold onto the ball well a lot of times opponents just snatch it away from his hands that being said one of the best lob threats ive seen and his size is imposing on the defensive end forcing opponents to tilt their shots and miss when going into paint idk how you teach better hands just need to be more physical and improve hand eye coordinationtheres no guarantee the pelicans liked maluach more or less then queen unless a report has came out saying soi understand hes and raw but are hands something that can be developed i cant think of any big that was labeled as having bad hands eventually getting over itit was extremely raw but seeing the night and day difference with how teams approached their scheme on offense when maluach was on the floor is already something im looking forward to seeing develop in the nba and his above average offensive reboundingeffort but mid defensive rebounding is exactly what was on his scouting report so im not sure where there is to be surprised there his hands were raw too but ball handling and such was never something hyped up about his gamemy biggest worry is that despite being tremendously gifted physically and a hard worker hes just not skilled enough to really become a great nba center a serviceable rotational big is the floor but the ceiling could be a lot lower than people thinkhollinger used to have insights now he seems like a cranky old man who thinks his dad jokes are hilarious theres a reason he didnt last long in an nba front officepeople in the hawks sub would call you crazy if you said this guy wasnt worth trading up formy thoughts as someone who also watched all his sl games our coach forced him to take a bunch of s so thats a nonissue he was also doing a lot of post ups and dribble drives which i assume the coaches also asked him to do because he never did that at duke hes not good at either of these things and was not drafted for them his hands were absolutely a concern i watched him fumble a few passes he was drafted to catch lobs and interior passes putting pressure in the paint this was a bummer to see and i was surprised because he looked like he had this stuff down at duke his presence as a rim protector is massive well see how he looks against full nba rosters but in sl they just didnt contest him i was very happy to see that his perimeter defense was solid for a hes shown that he has potential to be an elite defensive anchor his rebounding struggles are hopefully due to him being and simply not at his full strength yet we saw the same thing happen to him against houston in the final and they had a lot of older players on that team overall the primary concern is the drops if he cant catch tricky passes he will basically be rudy gobert on offense hopefully that was just a fluke otherwise im gonna be bummedeven just holding on to beal if he got injured would have been a better longterm move than the stretchthinking three seasons ahead is why okc houston and san antonio are in the situation they are in thinking about improving the team this year is why phx is in the situation it is incant improve the team this year because were currently over the second apronthey are so limited in what they could do right now even after buying out beal are they even improving the team in a meaningful way does winning games instead of actually count as improving the team technically its more wins but neither win total would be considered a success so what does that even matter are you really improving your situation if you tread water and drown after an hour instead of drowning right awayif ishbia just keeps approaching the team from what will help this season nothing will ever really developwe did that for a couple years after kawhi and it lead to some wildly unentertaining win seasons with derozan and aldridge where we were clearly going nowhereyou think it was fun as a spurs fan watching us trade away dejounte murray and derrick white and draft josh primo blake wesley and malaki branham it wasnt fun to win games two seasons in a row but you dont get wemby castle and harper without going through thatso yeah keep trying to improve the team for the current season just get used to winning between and games every season because thats what happensyeah use your eye test and ignore the large body of evidence that show this isnt an issue everyone knew maluach years old and only playing basketball for years in his life was a project but the suns arent realistically trying to compete for a couple years so it makes a ton of sense to take himthe suns traded deandre ayton then drafted store brand deandre aytoni love khaman as a person but i dont see the potential in himi know hes a project but ive been really down on him since that rebound elimination game at duke centers need to rebound if he cant do that then he wont be good and if he couldnt learn to do that against college kids then how is he going to do that against these grown ass menive said this over and over he looks like a bust to me hope im wrong for phoenix fans sake after that semifinal game against houston in the ncaa tourney when he could only muster rebound against undersized but strong bigs i wasnt impressed yes hes raw but weve seen that storyline over and over again in the nbaif only there had been a rim protecting big with good hands and serious hops available to themtwolves had to settle for beringersummer league doesnt matter but ive still never gotten an answer to a question ive asked a bunch of times in what way is maluach different than mo bambamaluach is a bustkwame brown loldude has let down written all over himyea u think people just saw the measurable and the instincts and thought they will be able to turn him into a serviceable player skill wiseto me getting zero rebounds in the ncaa elimination game was a red flag and at least in my personal memory bank the highest bust potential for lottery picks is footers especially ones that started playing late i dont mean to overreact to one game but this post is a reaction to his summer league performance so what the heyhe reminds me of hasheem thabeet another huge guy with good movement for his size and relative inexperience on the court looking back at college dejuan blair really got the better of thabeet no knock on blairhe was a beast playing without acls but that should have been a signal that thabeet might really need a lot of work before he could be impactful on the courtwe know khaman is going to put the work in he does have veteran bigs around him but i think he would benefit from a skilled big being theresomeone like olynyk or al horfordi was a little perplexed by the narrative around him at draft time the believers sold him as this raw big man with sky high potential i saw him as a high floor low ceiling rim runner with no positive offensive skills i think the nba leaned towards my evaluation given his perceived slip to summer league performance indicative of success in the league follows an established pattern if youre good in summer league it doesnt really mean anything but if youre bad in summer league it is tellingthats all assuming that team is not going to be competitive it could end up being a mid round pick as wellexactlythis isnt really about maluach imo any team from the th spot in the draft down should could have taken the nola offerbrooklyn at is probably the one that stands out the most couldnt they have taken this deal and then packaged or of their sts to move back up and grab deminthat pels pick could be gold in with those prospects coming up maluach has tools but his hands are concerning af suns fo always thinking shortterm when they should be playing the long gamehow does dybantsa not end up in utah its lebron even as a project i think good hands are probably a thing that cant be coached that much every db in the nfl would rather be making wr moneyno you dont understand we need to label him a bust now and attach a completely unrelated scenario involving the pelicans to the suns because reasonsi think the point is that if youre going to wait a few years anyway why not gamble on that pelicans pick which has a pretty terrific chance of being top in a loaded draftcaring about summer league per is crazy lol im surprised someone out there is actually spending time calculating itcant believe they drafted guards who cant shoot if none of them hit marks should be firedegor looked fine as a wing he has to get stronger and get lower as a handler i dont think his ceiling is particularly high but i do think hell be a useful nba player if the jumper is real traore and saraf both came off of their seasons overseas traore in particular looked drained after every paint touch which he got a lot of his catch and shoot numbers were better than his off the dribble s in europe so i expect the shooting to even out saraf looked nifty and skilled but the jumper looked genuinely concerning danny wolf was perking up towards the end after some truly awful performances that being said he is still an interesting prospect drake powell did not playthe nets genuinely had a generationally awful draft lmaoim biased but yall keep hating on bronny so ill say this he legit looked better in terms of basketball instinct and ability than a bunch of this years first roundersnets missed on carter bryant imo i really wanted himoff ball player incredible defender if he gets a three we looking at kawhi dont even need him to be a star just do his role and not demand a tradedid you even read what hollinger wrotejoe dumars literally said they started making the offer at sopicking malauch and drafting williams deserved to be clowned as that series of moves kept you over the second apron and forced you to waive and stretch bealdont do that and the path to just waiving beal and getting off his contract in while still ducking the second apron becomes clearbrunson and trae youngsuch a lazy take to say this yeah the stats matter very little from summer league but the process which is whats being mentioned does if your a big you need to be able to catch the ball and he clearly struggled a lot with that which is an area of concern and shows how far off maluach could begiannis is probably the best example we currently have his hands were pretty terrible when he entered the leaguewell as a suns fan i saw alex len and ayton never develop handshouston is a real contender though would he have gotten minutes to develop therei dont like the ibaka comparison because he was a much better athlete in terms of speed and agility to me he projects more like desagana diopserge was an all time defender in his prime kamans highest potential is no where even close to that lolthese teams want a reason to feel better for passing on him all it comes down to is it a team this sub likes celtics lakers etc clearly a project give baby time is it a team this sub hates suns nets sixers etc bust fucking idiotsand right now that answer is no but timing and positioning is unlocked with by experience instead of raw attributes it doesnt always happen but experience is the only way to improve itthe hands and handle problems are concerning and for all his other tools it would hard cap his potential and that doesnt get fixed by experience alone it will take very good coaching to get it at least not be a liability but now he gets to sit behind a real center and wont feel the pressure to contribute immediately and maluach as a long term option is still better than a revolving cast of bums backups and journeymento say you dont see the potential is crazy game sample size conclusion he only played his usual minutes in that game and his other starting teammates had rebs while houstons starters dominated with rebsthe game before vs alabama he had a tied for game high rebi agree in a critical game tootwo completely different players bamba barely enters the paint hes scared to bump and bash insidemakes sense hes huge works hard has good defensive instincts its worth a shot at especially for a team that isnt one successful rookie away from contendingto be fair to maluach that day he learned his visa might be revoked and he could be deported hes definitely a project player but that game is an anomalyyeah and he had a good amount of games with just a couple of rebounds which stands out with his size and framelike compared to a guy like chet who was at a similar height and wingspan but was like lbs lighter chet was a much better rebounder in college some of that is due to playing in a weaker conference but still averaged rbs a game vs p teams in regular season and in the ncaa tourneythe best counter example is probably steven adams who also started basketball later and was raw in college too but ended up becoming one of the better rebounders in the league and was a lob threatjudging and coming to conclusions about any prospect based off a game they played against houston is not a logical conclusionit is easy to play a guy like maluach off the floor overall but we saw that happen in the nba too with rudy gobert and even chet holmgren and hartenstein in the nba finals going smaller and stretching the floor is making the rim protector an endangered species but every team still needs to have one or the threat of one to navigate matchups if actively coaching coaching is the most important position in the nba now and ott got his guy there is nothing to worry aboutsl shouldnt change anyones opinions of a player but this is absolutely a criticism ive seen of maluach from a few draft people going back to college so the fact its also apparently noticeable at sl isnt exactly a good thingochai had a horrible summer league and a very productive season offball guys can struggle in sl when the talent around them isnt nba calibrealex sarr had one of the worst summer leagues ever and has mostly played to expectations in the nba if youre bad in summer league it is tellingnot always i like to remember that nic batum was terrible in summer league and our fan base was convinced he was a bust but then his rookie season was great im sure there have been many others like that hes just the guy i always rememberthis really only applies to year summer league there are plenty of rookies who have bad summer league who become good playersmaluach also didnt even have a bad summer league he had a solid summer league not amazing but solidtrae and brunson were pretty bad in sltelling of whatjalen brunson was shit in summer leagueyeah i remember when reed sheppard was considered the next curry while wemby was a bustsummer league doesnt tell you what a player can do it tells you what a player cant do if they cant do a specific skill or role against crap tier competition then they wont be doing it in the regular season on the flip side putting up points against sub tier competition doesnt mean you can do that against actual nba size and athleticism too many box score watchers sl means nothing because player x did bad and he turned out ok without taking into context the what and who of the situationentirely wrong lmao summer league means jack shitwemby had a very meh first game in sl and people were ready to call him a bust lolrudy gobert with handles clown takei agree i cant think of anyone who was terrible in the summer league and then crushed it in the nba but there are scores of dudes who were summer league studs who never made it to a rosteri think its way more likely that the pels pick is a lotto pick than it is for the suns to be competitive lmao in fact id be shocked if the suns make the play ini wish the nets took that pelicans deal i could even argue that for the pelicansbucks pick alone would be good for brooklyn even without getting backishbia for all his talk in the last couple weeks about building the right way has clearly not learned anything the last weeks have been nothing but quick fixestrading durant and then using that pick in this draft when it sounds like they could have rolled it over to what would likely be an even better pick next season it answered the question what can we do in this years draft when they should have been asking what would be best for the phoenix sunsbuying beal out which commits them to five years of having mil per year in dead salary on their books ive seen suns fans cry a weak defense about how we had to get under the second apron to free ourselves up without acknowledging that mil in dead salary makes it harder to stay under the apron for the next years it puts them at a disadvantage against the entire rest of the league in and but i guess enjoy being under the second apron in this answered the question how do we get under the second apron when they should have been asking in the next years how do we maintain roster flexibility in order to build a contenderthey rushed to make devin booker the highest paid player in the league they were answering the questions how do we sell tickets this year and make sure we have our own starthey should have been asking with the complete trainwreck that our roster is what exactly does having devin booker get usim not saying they should have just traded him though they should have considered it but he still had two years left on his deal extending him and making the th best player in the league the highest paid will do what for them every move has been to make them as good as possible today thats going to get them like wins in the west and screw their futureim going to wait to see how he handles things in real games before taking too big of a judgement from a tiny sample sizeyup this is my biggest complaint with the pick amare had elite hands from day same with jokic bad hands put a low ceiling on a rim running big man especiallyreasons being the pelicans offered that package for maluach i agree this is all an overreaction but there was a very good reason to connect this to the pels lollooks like a middling chance at top given whats transpired over the last couple lotteries but theoretically true unless youre sure of the one youre picking now will be all that a year of development is a year of developmentjohn hollinger is literally the guy who invented per lmao thats the only reason it matters to him heresaying they drafted guards to me is a bit dishonest danny wolf was playing as a big in summer league drake powell is a wing the other three are guards with egor again playing more as an off ball wing in summer league weve seen multi guard lineups in the league before anyway that being said its far too early to even judge these guys imoi think he just solely focused on bpa and disregarded fit in the hopes of maximising their chances of getting a franchise building blocksi see the vision but its risky because its hard to foster their developemt in a poorly fitting teamas a nets fan i will say that sean marks has hit on every first pick he has made before this draft and had never selected before he missed on one guy dzanan musa who has since been named st team in the euroleague so does that even count as a misscaris levert jarrett allen cam thomas dayron sharpe jury is still out on the duo of dariq whitehead who has been injured since duke and noah clowney who was mostly injured last season but looked good as a rookiein addition sean marks drafted nic claxton at the top of the second roundto me that is an excellent draft record considering where they were pickedso im not worried at all about draft picks in fact a usa today mock draft from last november had traore at drake powell at saraf at and demin at th overall i believe the nets scouts are great evaluators of talent and jordi fernandez will coach them up and develop them into fine rotation players in the nbaall of them are development projects are will likely have rough rookie seasons but lets check back in at the end of their third year and i reckon theyll all look like good bets to stick in the leaguenets clearly going for a type of player someone who can playmake for othersegor shot from during summer leaguedanny wolf and drake powell are not guards and egor is he can play on the wing i agree that if none of his draft picks hit marks should be firedmate its julycarter bryant has a he just needs to improve his on ball gameyeah and it felt like an overreactionits interesting its mostly raptors fans commenting on this everyone in toronto including their analysts want this man to fail after passing on himthe suns were already over the nd apron and saved million dollars with the mark trade beal was always going to be waived and stretched you could of read one article and knew thisdude received a grand total of lobs the entire summer league talk about minuscule sample size maluach displayed these exact weaknesses at duke this isnt new information to anyone but nba fans seeing him for the first timeright but if you also watched the sl games and saw the suns guard play you wouldnt be having these takes already eitherstruggled a lotdo you have any stats for that the kid is but somehow despite his struggling put up pts and rebs per possessions with a ts playing mingm in the accgiannis was basically the main reason projects were taken highly once he started taking off he is the success story everyone uses for any project guy who has good physical stuffhow big are maluachs hands i think giannis having a huge hand size measurement is a big factor to him eventually learninghis body was still growing a bunch though which could explain his coordination issues he was also more of a wingforward so the ability to catch lobs wasnt as vitalthats what i hated about ayton the most he had no handsdiop was a horrible offensive player with hardly any net positive skills on that side maluach is a solid shooter already shot really well from the ft line in college and clearly has a soft touch on his jumper diop was a career percent free throw shooter and essentially focused percent of his effort on defenseagreed maluachs upside is unlikely to be as solid as ibakas i was trying to find centers from africa as a comp and for the upside scenario it wasnt easy finding a suitable comphe has zero ability to move laterally even if you think the ball skills will come and the game will slow down for him mentally hes a supposed defensive anchor who turns into a ghost anytime he gets more than feet from the basketi dont sorry glad we took cmb over himtheres certainly potential but theres also the fact that he was shaded against worse competition than hes ever going to face in the league by playing alongside flagg at duke there were very legit concerns that the gravity flagg had on both offense and defense dramatically impacted what maluach was asked to do at any given moment and it effectively covered up a lot of fundamental issues i dont think its crazy to be concerned kid could develop into a good big for yall but its entirely possible hes gonna be a massive bustnah but were not talking about or rebounds zero rebounds for supposedly the most dominant big man on the floor is absolutely crazy and definitely should not be written off because it was just one gameas a fucking midget myself rebounds in minutes as a seven footer is something i just cant get past lmao and according to ops stats this is more than a game sample size rebounding is incredibly hard to teach and even then great rebounders like mitch rob struggle a little bit when they first come in the league because they are young men expected to bang with the biggest dudes on earth nurk is ass as a center but hes ft lb and can rebound its not the s any more and there are no off nights for a footer so even after you account for the physical load of being ish years old and trying to push dudes whove spent the last years getting brolic theres the mental load of getting shoved around day in and day out in front of tens of thousands of people that would be incredibly difficult for someone even if they had amazing mental fortitude every one in the draft has a chance to be great but if im picking dudes that i think are the least likely im going with kmfair enough maluach definitely is not afraid to get physical i do like that about himno chance an nba lottery prospect gets deported lolim not sure what basketball you were watching if you think chet has been played off the court against anyone other than jokic and even then he just moved to guard someone other than jokici wouldnt even say hartenstein was played off the court id just say he wasnt working as well as chet and against the pacers the double big lineup wasnt working as well as it had in prior seriesyeah its one thing if a guy who shot from three for four years in college suddenly shot over half a dozen sl games or whatever but when guys have question marks on certain things in college and look shit in those same areas in sl it might actually be worth thinking aboutjalen brunson averaged ppg on percent shooting in summer league would you rather someone be good than bad in sl sure but its no death sentenceand this is somehow downplaying it he was horrible as a rd year playerwhat expectations being a high pick in a terrible draft class on a terrible team so its tough to actually evaluate just wondering what you meani remember watching trae young get outplayed by junior robinson when i went to sl or years agowemby wasnt bad in summer league or considered a bust he had one game in the summer league which was bad and it wasnt even that bad tbh and people made fun of him for it and then immediately came back with a very good game nobody serious was looking at his summer league in totality and saying he wasnt going to be anythingfranz traenic batum didnt exactly crush it but he was terrible in summer league and has been a very solid player for a long time his rookie year he started like games for a win team so he was pretty good right away toou have a very short memoryits also the best of pelsbucks so id say the odds of at least one of the pels or bucks being in the lottery is greater than the suns being competitivetheyre talking about the pels being competitive obviouslyidk about all this homie what would you have them do other than go back in time and not make the decisions that got them here in the first placehave to get under the second apron the suns arent the only team doing kinda wild shit to accomplish that i dont like waiving and stretching the beal but i also dont know the alternative keep him and let him be mid for his contract and let it expire naturally have to resign booker at earliest opportunity since ishbia blew up what was a very promising young roster and mismanaged all the assets we had in pursuit of a very flashy and very flawed team that was never going anywhere if you dont give him this contract then you potentially make things worse in a whole different way if the pelicans offered that next year best of bucks or them pick then yeah we shouldve taken that over who we got but otherwise we did need a center to at least try and be competitive cant bottom all the way out since we dont have our own picks gotta at least tread water and hope something breaks your waynope the subreddit has spoken hes a bust i dont make the rulesyea his size personality coachability make him worth at least a shot but its not just sl even his entire year at duke playing against non pros his handsinstincts raw timing was off maybe even less than thabeet despite being more mobile than himhe has some hope in that he seems to have a soft touch on his shot showing some take on the game but even his instincts to go and get the swat of a ball were not that great and was less of a force in college despite the sheer size advantage that you would thinkbut many would take a shot on him but definitely some worrying signs he doesnt have to be like embiid but defensively he should still have more impact and be a force with his skill and abilitiesdrummond never overcame his awful handsoh i didnt know that the pelicans offered them that i wouldve taken it but i do see what theyre attempting to do with maluachi cant remember the last time hollinger had something nice to say about an nba playeri get drafting for bpa but this is like hinkie drafting three centers at some point you have to consider playing time and developmenti think they all have the potential youre describing but i wonder if theyll be able to develop properly without getting in each others waythats not even close to excellent bro wtf the best player on that list is jarret allen and hes just okay maybe above averageyeah hes the one i have the most faith in with wolf being a close ish second the rest is a crapshootok now post his byu statsand considering the nbas hit rate out of the top if even one of them makes an all star game at some point that alone probably makes it a successits july but they drafted a bunch of extremely unimpressive players with archetypes that dont ever go that far in the nbalol i have no feeling towards maluach in either directionthey saved nothing with the williams trade because they picked up micics option to complete it which they could have declinedthey also traded two picks which could have been used elsewhere to shed salarythey had many options to get under the second apron that did not involve stretching beals contracti already knew it was just summer league and yet still having to watch yuri collins and boogie ellis had me wanting to gouge out my eyeswhich is a lot of people tons of nba fans dont follow college as closely asreally does to show what a major disaster it was for the nba to try to get fans to move away from catching college games fans having no clue about any strengths or weaknesses about a top pick coming into the league used to not happeni love when people use per stats over the real stats really paints a good picture of the player not just an imaged version of them his actual stats in college were points rebounds in minutes everyone looks good when you use per stats which is why they are meaningless also do you know how to read when did i mention him in college or even struggling overall maybe double check what i said and you will see i just was talking about him struggling to catch the ball in summer leagueper possessions is quite a stat for college basketball he averaged with blocks per which is pretty good nothing extraordinary for a footerhard to verify the numbers but giannis is said to have inch hands and maluach is measured at an estimated javale mcgee with a shotnot saying there arent questions but to say you dont see the potential is crazyi sure hope he can eventually shoot itits not crazy to be concerned but its crazy to say that theres not potential thereoh yeah there is absolutely nothing about this current administration that is wildly unpredictable and unnecessarily crueli would have said theres no chance the military and federal agents start marching through the streets raiding houses but i would be wrongi thought there was no chance trump would pardon the biggest sex trafficker the modern world has ever seen we will seeeven if you dont believe its possible the point still is that a year old kid like khaman would not have felt certain hed be fine and it would have clouded his mentality going into that gamei was excited for his potential when we traded for him thought he had an okaynotgreat second half of the season with us that year then that summer leagueoh boyhe did not look like an nba player it was alarmingespecially as you said for a third year player but he really found his groove and became one of the most reliable rotation guys during the season the reality is the summer league rosters hardly ever look anything like the regular season rosters not just in talent level but in player archetypes and roles even as a third year guy ochai wasnt all that great at creating his own offence but thats not his role on the main squadyeah franz was so badbatum was a defensive minded jack of all trades wing with relatively limited shooting not a bad player to give minutes to on an actual nba roster if you have good bbiq and at least decent shooting and he was a perfectly fine role player in that playoff caliber blazer squad which certainly didnt need him on offense on a summer league roster though oof which is why im cautiously optimistic on yang who would also play better with an actual roster of nba players but nonetheless did pretty good even surrounded by a squad of sl chuckersbucks are gonna be a play in team at the very least the east is weak af and giannis is gonna be able to carry even without damethe alternative to having beal play midball next year for you all is to have green and brooks play midball while you pay beal to play somewhere else for the next five yearsdoing that stretch to get under the second apron this year will make it more difficult to stay under the aprons every year until ishbia signed up to basically run his team at a handicap for five years for the purpose of saving money and getting flexibility today when they have a dogshit roster and almost no draft picks to help the roster improves beyond dogshitso yes you let beal play out at least one more season until his contract is more tradable it wouldnt be fun but thats the way it goes when the owner does dumb stuff because he thinks hes smarter than everyone when you mess up like he did there are no good choices just degrees of less bad when you overindulge in sweets at some point you need to eat your vegetablesbut building the right way takes patience and luck and the less patient you are the less luck youll havefor example tread water and hope something breaks your waywhat would that even look like phx looks like a team that if everything goes incredibly right for them might win games in the west this season thats what the th seed absolute best case scenario phx makes the playin and gets swept by okc as a suns fan would you be happy with that result especially since getting that result means delaying building something better in the future because doing that means using assets and moves to improve right now rather than roll improvements over to the future and improve is in quotes because is wins instead of actually meaningfully better its like being stuck in traffic and thinking things are much better because youre now creeping along the highway at mph instead of thats still too slow to get you where you want to go in a timely manner when thinking about the future beyond the season right in front of you would you look back and say wow im really glad we didnt make any moves that would have compromised that win season as for booker does paying him milyr actually help their team i dont mean in the abstract is booker a winning player i like him and think he is a winning player but phx has screwed up their roster cap flexibility and draft situation for years to come they arent realistically competing for anything meaningful for years with the trajectory theyre on right now thats the true context under which they are operating so does having devin booker actually get them any closer to being a contender or not i would say definitely not they will be lucky to even make the playin with him this year what does it matter if they dont have him especially if moving him could mean they get a bunch of muchneeded draft picks in return im not saying they should definitely trade booker but it doesnt seem like any decision has been made with the idea what would be the best thing for the phoenix suns considering this roster has zero chance of contending until at least then i dont know why youd make any decisions at all that dont focus around that question keeping him is a valid answer to the question whats best for the suns but right now phx is making shortsighted moves every year while ishbia plays im a deal maker and building a contender dressup and avoids admitting the obvious this team is stuck in the muck and has no tractioneat your vegetables ishbiaaw man as a wolves fan hes been super complimentary of nickeil alexanderwalker in a way that most guys havent i think he just has his own takes and isnt afraid to say them even when doing so ruffles some feathersalso this piece is literally about the worst of summer league which came after a separate article about the best of summer leaguei cant remember the last time he had any insights that were actually relevant analysis as opposed to largely surfacelevel observationsthe plan is clearly to play multi guard lineups which isnt a foreign concept egor was more of a wing during summer league and has described himself as a playmaking wing shying away from the point guard label traore and saraf are probably going to share the floor a good amountspend a lot of time in the g league in long island danny wolf will get time as a big man off the bench and drake powell is a wing its a challenge to develop rookies but its not like the nets have a lot of talent anyway i say this as someone who did not like the overall draft btwi feel they all actually play different roles and positions but do share ball handling and playmaking skills traore is a pg powell is a defensive guardwing saraf is an big guard able to score and handle the ball demin is a playmaking wing wolf is a faceup ball handling pf or possibly a c if the team is playing outokay go through each draft and find better players after each of those players were draftedits consistently very good drafting for so late in the first roundyou can improve a players shot you cant give a players good ball iq we picked the best passers in the draft court vision is importantim not sure why youre still arguing this it was known since the previous trade deadline that they were going to stretch his contract if they didnt find a trade partnerhe has great touch around the basket and shoots a respectable clip from the free throw line not worriednope some people are heavily protected and top athletes are one of themthat involves regular people not top tier athletesif giannis misses extended time like games were not making the playin its unlikely but we are not at all guaranteed decent seeding regardless of how weak the east isso keeping beal while he is basically a large symbol of front office failure in the hopes that he changes his mind on his ntc he doesnt get hurt and rehabs his value as a player a team wants him and is willing to take the last year of that dealmeanwhile were over the second apron which makes trying to make this headscratcher of a roster better mostly impossible based on my limited understanding of the cbawere not thinking about because its and thinking that way as far as not resigning who is arguably the best star weve had homegrown in franchise history would be a complete failure and honestly you might wanna consider selling the team again before that since you might be the most hated owner not in dallas like just picture that you come in destroy the entire team and trade away literally the only thing you had with the hope that the person who fucked it up does better with a fresh start i saw the writing on the wall with all this when he came in saying he wanted kd and its been all downhill since then but if he turned this into book asking out then idk what id doyeah and they cant all play point theres only one ballegor had good shooting stretches at byu too in fact when he came over from real madrid everyone was gushing over how much his shot looked like it had improved lots of people in the nba draft sphere had also bought into the shot in nonconference particularly after the central arkansas and uc riverside games not saying its impossible for demin to improve his shot but this feels like the exact same thing that happened at byuim arguing that stretching his contract was a bad idea and didnt have to happen im not sure why im being downvoted for saying that as if it wasnt possible to not stretch his contractfor nowsenegal womens basketball training in us cancelled after visas rejectedand then just this morning venezuelan little league team denied travel visas to us for world series assume hes healthy considering hes never played less than games a season in his entire careertheyre casting a wide net to see what fits the new identity of the team not that crazy for a rebuildforever i dont think you realize how protected and privileged the top of any profession areneither are top at their professions like maluach isnot op but that logic holds true for a lot of players until one freak injury screws up everything dame had seasons of then its been dicey ever sincethe police broke solefoloshas leg for no reason and he was a much bigger name than maluach took years for him to receive a settlement',\n",
       " 'contested fade away middies just hit differentthis is the kind of stuff that stuck in tatums memoryi miss being able to watch kobe when he was on he was onthis kinda shit is what younger people who think kobe is grossly overrated dont realize kobe had the ability to take over and win you a crucial playoff game almost single handedly his efficiency doesnt hold up against modern nba but it has to be viewed in the context of his era imo kobe created the stan culture a whole generation of fans choose to be kobe fans regardless of where they lived everyone knew who he was and if you threw something into a basket thered be a chance youd yell kobefeed me that entry pass turn around jumper at omg so beautiful and i hope we can all appreciate that the shot at doesnt happen in modern nba because the offensive player would flail themselves against the defender while screaming like a maniac not that kobe and his more crafty contemporaries didnt do plenty of rip through moves and the like but the foul game was about baiting the defender into making a mistakeand he didnt need free throw attempts to get those pointsthe game has changed so much since the late s eraoh the hate brigade hasnt woken up yet i get to enjoy pure kobe dominance its greatlook at all those beautiful middies now all we see is dudes jacking up s smhits that utter demoralization factor that cannot be understood by looking up a stat sheet basketball is psychology and when someone hits such immensely tough shots on you at the clip that he did they create a certain mythology around themselves that you cant help but let it fuck with your brain a little logic be damned thats why most players have kobe around all time even though hes notderons exit from utah is so depressing you just wonder what that team couldve been if he and sloan couldve worked out their differences iirc it wasnt even anything crazy i think the main hangup is that sloan didnt like deron changing plays without informing him or the rest of the team something like thatderon vs chris paul was a real debate until deron left utah he was a better floor general than rose and westbrook and a better scorer than rondoe just looked up how old deron is and found out hes only years younger than tony parker lmfao thats crazythe philippines miss you kobe you will always be our favorite old millennialskobe just had that mentalityphil jackson absolutely owned the jazz for years dwill team was something special but we couldnt break through kobe ane philyeah but i never watched him play because im a virgin nephew so let me impress my fellow virgins by repeating old talking pointskobe was the most technically gifted player of his time no debate and he proved it every night in his years he was so technically gifted that you sometimes forget that he was also one of the greatest athletes in the league toolook at the clip at seconds he steals the ball excellent defensive anticipation and is rd favorite to get the loose ball and glides through them all comfortably and finishes with a totally in control picture perfect reverse layup effortlessly fasti wouldnt consider that to be prime ak considering by he was on the downside of his career already he actually was declining for a couple of years by this point he peaked in as a player and was essentially a defensive specialist for the rest of his career and even then by he was mostly just a reputation playerthe skill level in these highlights is absolutely insane kobes game was pure art in motion very beautiful to watch he had perfected every move by this point in his career so fluid so graceful nobody comes close to playing like this anymorepretty sure prime kirilenko blocked kobe like times in minutesagainst teams with plus wins not some weak eastern conference lebron ducked kobe in the finalsthis kobe js like playoff jimmy butler but a level betterthere arent players greater than kobeprime ak is getting postered by baron davisno wasted movements one of the smoothest and deadliest players to ever play the game unbelievable talenti think the coolest thing is how many of the shots are against the best defender on the team versus now how much easier it is for superstars with matchup huntingak good times manand people put the most overrated player of all time curry above himprime kobe was unstoppable just ask that girl from the colorado incidentpretty sure ak prime was more like or something like that featured boozer and deron lol ronnie brewer name dropthe same reason why a lot of older players today speak so highly of kobe they remember when kobe killed their teamand he was always on against the jazz when he went off against us scoring in his last game i was just like of coursei hated him his entire career and id give anything to have him still alive it truly sucked when he diedits weird how peoples opinions on his efficiency has waxed and waned over the years there was definitely a period of time where hed get a ton of shit by hollinger and others for being an inefficient chucker but then people started accounting for free throw rate and he suddenly looks less horrible for sure he took too many long s but his prime basically coincided with the long era in hindsight his true shooting would never hold up to guys who play in the math centric world of todays nba but then again neither would any historical nonbig not named jordan even big tim was basically a true shooting percentage guy on lower volume and easier shotsthe kobe hate makes me realize just how young redditors are these guys are so young that their only memories of kobes career is his post achilles years where he was shell of his former self just that itself is insane to me and makes me feel old af despite only being you had to witness him to know literally no one has ever came close to replicating mj kobe was as close as it will ever get the media has done and still do everything they can to discredit his legendary legacymy favorite thing to do in my youth was yell kobe when tossing some trash and if it missed going awwww shaq lmaowhen someone tells me kobe shot mid fg i always ask if they saw him playwhy it is my belief he took the highest of difficult shots in the nba and if you omit the extreme years rookie and post its closer to high si mean the amount of long twos and crazy shots he took and hit the percentage wild as fuck loland say what you want that shit looks fucking gorgeous when they go inim not going to argue with anyone who believes lebron is better but id be fucking damned if someone tells me theyd prefer watching lebron drive for a lay up that a silky ft fade away from kobekobe created stan culture theres the cult of jordan before himnot to mention a good chunk of the inefficient years were him dragging some awful teams in the playoffs guess who was getting double teamed non stop and had minimal help on offense the younger people these days are missing that context kobe was on some bad teams that he forcefully made decent by sheer willif you need bucket in a win or go home playoff game there isnt a player in todays game id take over kobe sga is probably the closestkobe shot more free throws than sgaappreciate game lil bro all yall do is mindlessly hategame is changing constantlydont worry this sub will come out with a kobe isnt even top post soonno one in these threads denies he was a phenomenal player its the threads that talk about how great of a person he was that deserve to be contestedyou can enjoy his game whenever you want bro lol no ones stopping you but if its annoying to remember that he was a fucking rapist that says more about youkawhi and demar are fun to watch because of their tendency to shoot a decent amount of middiesthe problem with todays game is everyone is told to play the same way basketball is a game of creativity its suppose to be artistic and it should be fun its entertainment watching everyone jack up s like the celtics is boring and its heartless basketball younger guys dont understand it cause todays game is all they knowyes because theyre worth more points and players now shoot threes at the same rate kobe shot his middieswatch sga for middies he might be the best ever midrange shooter percent he was so technically gifted that you sometimes forget that he was also one of the greatest athletes in the league toohe wasnt thats what makes his skillbased achievements so much more astounding he couldnt run like a gazelle he couldnt jump like a kangaroo he couldnt palm a ball like an octopus but he still dominated opponentsyeah i remember his back getting screwed up kinda early in his careerak wasnt the primary defender on kobe during those series it was brewermost wins against win teams in the playoffs in nba historykobes efficiency criticism has always been massively overblownhe had an above league average ts every single season of his career until he tore his achilles and has the same ts as tim duncan and hakeem but on way higher volume and ts is a stat that greatly favors big menyeah even in this clip alone theres like shots that would never be taken in todays nba kobe would have made himself one of the best point shooters in the league if he played in this erafor tim thats even worse ts for a big man is definitely not efficient and does not even remotely hold uphe would have much more spacing around him and he would be much better point shooter hed do everything to winalso in his best seasons he was shooting ish if i remember correctly and for a shooting guard shooting loads of long s and a lot of them very difficult thats actually insanely goodbut if kobe was playing in todays game he would arguably be better he would have the gather step and no hand checking he would get to the rim or get wide open middies all game and he probably would shoot more s too in hindsight his true shooting would never hold up to guys who play in the math centric world of todays nbahed have so much space to operate hed definitely hold up to guys who play in todays nba if given that much spacing instead of these bigs and pfs clogging the lanecrazy because he tore that achilles at and was on a tear before toohe also cemented the nba as a true global sport in the east probably more kobe jerseys even today then the next biggest players combinedthe media had it out for him ever since he called them a bunch of idiots back thenits because of the rapeehh jordan was universally loved and accepted by everyone as the goat he transcended basketball in a way no one else could tough to be an mj stan when it was weird not to love himmore importantly it happened before the internet was really a thing which is a crucial part of stan culturekobe gets buckets thoughwhats hilarious is this coulda been about bron or harden or a bunch of players but you chose to take offense at sga lolshoe sure does fit huhit annoys me cause it serves no purpose in a discussion about basketball yes hes a rapist but what exactly are you accomplishing with that comment everyone posting in an nba subreddit knows that its not bringing any type of awareness or other positive benefit to rape victims its just edgy teens spamming shit but it doesnt correlate to the subreddit or discussion of the thread in the slightesthe was tho i dont take points off a mans character just for his mistakes but also his actions after says more about you that you continue to villify someone who after his mistake did everything in his power to make up for that like the way he went about it as a young man he took accountability for it he didnt do the derrick rose we men you can assume and yet no one calls derrick rose out for what he did derrick rose and his friends gangraped that girl and yet no one goes derrick rose is a rapistto me honestly the people who continue to try and point fingers at someone who you could look at with your own eyes and see that he was sorry for it are the ones with more to say or stuff to hide i have no issue remembering it i have an issue with people continuing to point it out as if he continued to live his life in that way he did something he was a pos and he tried his hardest to fix that if you cant see the growth in that and you continue to say kobe rapist it says more about you and the way you are as a person everybody deserves a chance at redemption thats why kobe was great in so many peoples eyes and because of that redemption people like you feel the need to add that in because you have your perception of the way life should be continue trying to spread your gospel and i will continue to tell people mine well see how many people you preach to in the end bye bye everything you said is exactly how i feel about todays gamei remember when melo talked about playing for houston and was told he was the missing piecewas then told not to shoot mid range shots as if it wasnt his bread and butter and was essentially ehat made his career lmaoeverything is so robotic and manufactured in todays nba moneyball or in basketballs case moreyballjacking up those threes is more efficient and more likely to win you games until the playoffs starttheres tons of variety in todays game saying its all the same because of high pt attempts is just as reductive as saying s ball was all the same because of low pt attemptsholy fuck what is this takejust off the top of my head i got mj kobe kd dirk i could argue for melo demar cpi know but the op mentioned prime aktheyre hatin because their teams are always the victims of kobethe basketball world was robbed of vino kobe and the fact that his last playoff game was at age is a travestychina loves kobewasnt weird for knicks fansas does sgajust as many as kobe on better shootinghit dog will holleri mean he didnt reference sga either just a general point about hatinglol lets keep it a buck this is not about lebronits not a good thing to unequivocally lionize and glorify awful people if it makes you feel better the vast majority of people dont give a fuck about his actions and still love his game just fucking close your eyes if seeing a handful of posts causes you such trauma lmfaophilippines as wellchina recognizes talents and hard workers dumb american doesnt watch the game but stats for their parleydeletedindia too the two most populous countrieslets not compare the physicality and pacing of the mids to today and their effects on scoring efficiency they are different eras just leave it at thati never said it gives me trauma i just find it mildly annoying like i found that last sentence of your comment mildly annoying because its an insufferable way to communicate when you can do it respectfullyi agree with your point about not glorifying and lionizing awful people but posts about him being a rapist in a discussion about kobe v duncan isnt doing anything to dispel that nor is it doing anything to contribute to the point of the thread nor is it doing anything to bring any modicum of benefit to rape victims its just pointless in my opinionmaybe actually learn chinese and read their forums instead of going off with your fantasies about other countrieskobe is almost a god in china iykyklebron fans probablywhat hes saying is literally true its widely known that kobe was very very popular in china even the redeem team documentary wade said when they got to china they felt small compared to kobe hes that big there bigger than bron and mjim chinese and have friends and family are that in chinamaybe instead of focusing on a bunch of forums which reflect the loud minorities typing about shit see how popular he is in the real world where theres literally thousands of people chanting his name a lot of unhinged people china is not unique in that aspecthell you get that kind of comments here on this on the regular',\n",
       " 'is this even remotely believable genuine questionto simplify this as much as possible dont have sex with anyone who cant enthusiastically consent it is not a gray area people who cant decline sex with you for any reason are not enthusiastically consenting to make this even simplerpeople who cant consent intoxicated people and people impaired by drugs people below the age of consent people who would face retaliationanyone ever head him speak before chance this is his writing if its just his lawyer writing this then do it in the rd person i dont know why but this really bothers meits crazy how drinking alcohol is this big excuse people use ive been drunkfubar plenty of times and though it does make you feel less restrained your brain is still in there telling you right vs wrongonly way i could see it even a little differently is if he was black out drunk and couldnt remember anything but even then youre too fucked up to do anything anywaysyou raped someone and were convicted beyond a reasonable doubt fuck you benim so sorry we have to go through this againagaini never understood why if both people are drunk and agree why is the male usually if not always the one charged for rape if they were the same amount of drunk and everything else equal why isnt she being charged for rape as well idk the entire situation so who knows but it always seems to work out that wayhe really did the kobe challengeyeah man theyll love this at your parole hearingsedited she said as dawn was approaching his wife at the time who was in sacramento with their children checked his location and saw he was still out and became upset with him over the phone leading mclemore to hastily leave there was consent and there was no withdrawal of consent until after the fact said winemiller arguing that the woman became upset about mclemores exit that provided plenty of reason for her to resent and to regret the encounter i cant imagine a woman who wouldnt i fled because i was cheating on my wife and not because im a rapist is quite the defensei saw some comments on ig that said the victim is being racist and looking for a payday its sad that people think the victim has some ulterior motive is a kind humble year old man father that just happened to have sex with a very intoxicated year old at a party people who knoes him knoes hr is a good manhumbling is a weird word to use given the context of him saying hes innocent but alright you should only have sex with someone you are in a committed relationship with casual sex is a mistake and we need to stop normalizing it as a societynoquestions that unfortunately went unaddressed under the constraints of the law as it standsnot saying hes innocent but i feel like you can be drunk and still consent idk if thats some sort of hot take i just dont think its that black and white that any intoxicated person or person on drugs cannot consentif intoxicated people cant consent that means like of all sex is actually rapeits really that simple when in doubt just jerk off or something shit isnt worth iti dont know anything about this case i havent heard of it til now but if they were both drunk why are we acting like only the woman cant consent he cant consent either right so what is sex between two people that cant consentthis a million percent i was my squadron sarc rep and one of the biggest things i used to harp on with new guys was drunk means no all that doing multiple rounds at the bar or doing hunch punch in the dorms is a recipe for disaster ive seen many a career thrown in the dustbin from dudes caught in thisyeah its crazy to me that people are so horny they put themselves in this situation when they could just nut in the bathroom by themselves if they really need to get off that badlynever once have i been so horny i felt the need to force myself on someone its so much easier to just not do that lmaoif two people are intoxicated enough that neither can consent both people are rapistsyes men can be victimsbut thats not what happened hereben raped that woman and theres no version of the story where he sought genuine consent or where she was able to give it and he was perfectly able to consent know this wasnt consentual and run away and lie to the cops when asked about itso much heavy heart and deeply hurt and as a kid from st louis like i am sick of this fake empathyhumilty bullshit above all i am a father like its all just stupid canned corny lines seen a thousand times before they definitely used ai to helpwhy does it bother you the vast majority of statements you see arent written by the victim or the perpetrator thats why you have a lawyer you really think people are writing their own pr statement apologies etc something like of people incarcerated dont remember the crime they committed bc they were out of their minds on drugs unfortunately its a very real lived experience for many individuals i am in no way pardoning said crimes it just is what it isheres what ai said its difficult to determine exactly how many incarcerated individuals dont remember their crime butresearch suggests a significant portion of those convicted of violent offenses potentially claim amnesia for the crimethis is not exclusive to violent crimessome individuals convicted of sexual or property offenses also report memory lossthat one made me spit out my coffee i mean what the fuckthe of rapes that actually get convicted is crazy low because it is so hard to prove word vs word i wasnt on the jury but one would trust that there was more to the story than the rapists representation is letting on if there was a convictiondid you not read the part where she was passed out from drinking and only woke up because he was raping her dont both sides this shit thats shamefulbecause men are physically stronger than women and can physically resist in most cases so thats always a factor but i dont know this case in particularbig andrew tate energy in this post seriously dude come oni mean we arent the moral police we are trying to figure out if he raped someoneso yeah it could be a valid defense or part of onei think the issue is that in an intoxicated state she could not really consentim a retired er doctor i often worked with intoxicated patients sometimes we wanted to have their consent for procedures that have risks but getting consent from a drunk person is not useful if they cant understand what the risks and benefits are this is why a yr old cant consent to sex with an nba player because they lack the knowledge to not be exploited and they fail to understand the consequences so the law is supposed to protect them drunk people are treated like yr oldswhy would it not be even more humbling to go to prison for something you didnt docasual sex is normal and fine between two consenting individualsthats a bold claim what is your evidencequestions like yeah but did you see what she was wearingits not a hot take its pretty normal for people to feel like intoxication doesnt make you unable to consent to sex the issue is that drunk can cover everything from a few beers to blacked out and i think youd agree that theres somewhere on that spectrum where a person can say yes but it maybe shouldnt count theres also the likely fact that both persons involved are intoxicatedyou can consent but the other person cant know how intoxicated you are someone could appear pretty sober when in reality theyre blackout everyone is different on drugsalcoholits just too dangerous of a game to play tbhyou totally can but the point the poster was trying to make is why risk it the next day they could just say they were blacked out and dont remember consenting even though they clearly did while intoxicated you and the courts can verify that they were indeed drinking the night before but you would have to take their word for it if they said they blacked out or something so why take that riski am a retired er doctor i often needed to do pelvic exams many women told me that i did not need to leave and get a chaperone i never did an exam without a chaperone the chaperone is there to protect me im not a rapist and i know how to not be accused of rape people dont have to take my word for it she was a very mature yr old countless pedophiles she was a very clear headed drunk stuff rapists saylewis hamilton is likely a better driver than me even after beers but experience has taught us that people who drive drunk sometimes kill people and that is not ok you are not the exception dont drive drunk ever even if you are really horny most drunk drivers dont kill anyone and get home safe it is still not ok treat drunks like they are be nice to them but dont have sex with themi think technically youre incorrect right but then socially if two people are a bit drunk its socially acceptableadults go out for the sole purpose of going out getting drunk and hopefully finding someone to have sex with all the time lol men and women obviously they need to be clearly in their right mind and capable of making adult decisions but if the standard is you cant have sex if youre drunk theres just gonna be way less sex people need to be able to use their heads and not make everything so black and whitebeing drunk does not make you unable to consent being drunk to the point of incapacitation does though redditors will have you believing that unless you have verified their bac is below they cant consent in reality if youre out drinking and a person freely decides to have sex with you then they consented even if theyre a little drunk if the person is on the verge of passing out andor stumbling around then they did not consent even if they might verbally say something suggesting consenti think that men can consent while being drunk but i dont think women can or at least women around college age up to very early si get why its a thing but i dont get what happens if both parties are intoxicatedseriously reddit is fuckin wildthis is such a reductionist take and we gotta call this out she wasnt two beers in she was woken up by him having sex with her after passing out from alcohol this was percent rape dont try to paint this as a hookup gone south or any other bs know the difference and if you cant understand it take some time and do some selfreflection damnuse your brain theyre not talking about someone who had two glasses of wine theyre talking about people who are stumbling or slurring their words or otherwise clearly drunk to the point of losing their ability to make decisions for themselves this shit isnt hard just dont have sex with people who are too drunk and if youre not sure what too drunk means exactly err on the side of caution i know multiple people who have been raped because someone practically carried them to a hotel room after they drank too much the snarky little redditor thing of oh well i guess all sex is rape le checkmate is so annoying to me like turn on your brain for one secondfacts reddit people live on the internetput it on a tshirtmy problem and not that i have ever been accused of sexual assault or rape is that when i am wasted i dont notice other people are wasted i remember going to a college party sober a time or two and thinking man everyone is wasted is it always like this hardly ever noticed wasted people when i was on a similar leveli never really understood that famous line from as good as it gets at the time but now i think about it all the timewaking up to be like i did what but in jail has to be so fucking scaryi dont doubt this number at all but i wonder how many of them do remember but are trying to put a buffer between themselves and responsibility for their actionsciting ai bs for this is pretty fucking useless dont you thinknope didnt read any of it just what he wrote just nowim not saying both sides to this particular story i was just going off a different tangent if she passed out then of course thats straight up rapehow do you even know if shes telling the truth about being passed outwhat not even im saying if the situation is then why is only the male always in trouble i dont mean to this specific case i mean in generalno we know it wasnt a good defense because the jury found him guiltyidk what you mean im not on the jury im allowed to have personal opinions on the morality of his decisionsgotta disagree with you there its a purely hedonistic act which provides zero societal good next to its long list of potential negative impacts people do not take it nearly serious enoughits his personal opinion one i do not agree with what evidence does he need to providethat person should be held accountable if they got behind the wheel of a car and injuried someone i dont see why they shouldnt be held accountable for all their actions while drinking unless something like their drinks got spikedits also common to get drunk to have sec do and more than likely youll not have sex with that person as they have you a chance already i know it sounds fucking stupid but a lot of men and woman think so or youre a weirdo if you dont something like thatthat can happen but very unlikely for an average person the most common is people cant even stand talk straight or walk when they are blacked out drunkyeah well saying you cant remember doesnt mean didnt consentyeah i get that definitely not worth it just feels like its gotten a little bit out of hand in some instances again not referring to this case im just speaking in general termsi was with you until you started spouting sobroid propaganda did you know that so called sober drivers account for of all vehicular fatalitiesis that sarcasmthe man gets blamed all the time somehowin the gay community its known that intoxicated bottoms cannot consent to sex while intoxicated tops can unless the bottom is a power bottom in which case most of the power is being derived from the bottom since theyre doing most of the work so they can actually consent to sex while intoxicated but in those cases the intoxicated top cannot consent its very complicated when its two men having drunk sex because context is important to determine which party is more womanly and therefore deserving of infantilizationoh for sure fuck this dude he probably definitely raped her i was more just responding to a comment on the topic in general not this particular casethere are people that absolutely treat any amount of drunk as a morally grey area so lets not act like nobody is saying that they aremy theory of relativity you can tell how drunk someone is if theyre drunker than you if they are more sober than you you cant tell if theyre just a bit more sober than you or totally soberi poisoned our water supply burned our crops and delivered a plague unto our houseswhy i do not do xanaxthe shit people would do and genuinely could not recall what they did hours ago with a gun to their headi doubt that number greatly i dont believe for one second that a full third of prisoners have zero recollection of their crimes im going to need to see a reputable study but i doubt one exists and fully believe thats a completely made up statisticthats a pretty dumb tangent to post herebecause in general that isnt the case but if the woman was the aggressor she can absolutely be held liable for rape the situation is almost never and men are way more likely to be the aggressorswell say that instead of a cheeky comment making light of a serious situationjuries arent infallible though the evidence in this case sounded like it was just conflicting testimony on what happened which is why these cases are so hard to rule onyeah and hes a former nba player could have afforded the best legal defence money can buy and still got found guiltygreat just had nothing to do with whether he raped someone or not and someday if you get accused of a crime i hope no one brings up or hyper fixates on irrelevant mistakes or bad decisions youve madeto be clear im not defending him or suggesting he is innocenteating ice cream provides no societal good should we ban that too how is what other consenting adults do up to you in any way casual sex is a mistake and we need to stop normalizing it as a societythis is not stated as an opinion it is stated as a fact to be expresses a state of beingeven if it was stated as an opinion its not strange for someone else to challenge that opinion by asking what evidence the opinion is backed up by i know reddit struggles with human interaction but this is pretty basic stuffgetting behind the wheel while drunk is an action you take it wouldnt have happened if you didnt do it getting raped because youre too drunk to know whats going on thats an action someone else is taking against you if that other person didnt act it wouldnt have happened you shouldnt be held accountable actions of othersyou are viewing a victim of sexual violence the same way you view a perpetrator of vehicular violence simply because they both chose to drink thats fucked upattempting to read this made me feel dyslexiccan you restate your hypothesismy point is that its hard to tell how drunk someone is especially if youre also drinkingso youre saying of drivers the estimated number of drunk drivers on the road at a given time account for of accidentsthats more than x the expected amountive never seen anyone try to claim that warning people not to drive drunk is propagandai hope this was a joke but if by some bizarre chance you are serious i hope you live far away from me and everyone i love and that we never encounter you on the roadany cursory look back at the history of rape would would tell you that the overwhelming share of blame has and in many cases still does fall on the mostly female but also male victims as wellwhy do you feel the need to bring up this take on a post about a convicted rapist not the placetheres also a lot of sexually repressed subcultures where men and women both get wasted with the intent of lowering their inhibitions to have sex with each other thats how it was in the area i grew up and the fact everyone was so sexually repressed and didnt communicate at all made for a lot complex scenarios some of which id say were ok some that were not ok and some scenarios that were ok morally even if one or both parties later regretted their actions while intoxicatedyes this is the reality nowadaysalcohol tolerances range dramatically person to person i know some absolute light weights that would be black out off of two drinkswhere alcohol is involved even limited im teaching my kids its safer to err on the side of caution just dont engage in anything of a sexual nature because the ramifications are far worsemight be extreme but i feel this is the society we live in consent is too important and if someones ability to think clearly is clouded just donthave you ever encountered this irl or just online im genuinely curious bc it feels like a view youd see expressed in a tweet by like a year old who just discovered the idea and isnt understanding it with an adult level of nuance but ive literally never encountered an actual person who tried to accuse someone of rape because they had sex with someone who enthusiastically consented after drinking a single miller light or whatever theres so much stuff like this these days where we see a tweet or a reddit post or whatever espousing some wild charicature of what some group thinks collectively i guess feminists in this case people who are concerned about rape idk exactly and then we go wow i guess everyone in group holds this very inflammatory and unnuanced view the worlds gone so crazy but in reality its just like some teenager or college student with a half baked brain not fully understanding the point and completely unrepresentative of what youd experience if you interacted with an average member of group in real life yknow what i mean its easy to get convinced that lots of people hold these hardline black and white zero nuance viewpoints when youre just going online and seeing the posts of the most online people in that groupno but we werent just gonna wait around until you didof course its true ai said itwhy not just google iti see you mind is made up with a study i could link or notwhat a lovely way to do human interaction you are such a joythankyou for putting it so welli am just saying if you consent to something or choose to do something while you are drunk it is actually consentingchoosing it obviously im not saying if someone is drunk and is not actively enthusiastic about sex that that is okay i am just saying if a guy or girl is drunk and wants to have sex they are consentingabsolutely sorry i was just kinda word vomiting what i meant to say its pretty common for people to drink in order to hook up or have sex but the reality is you probably wont end up having sex with that person because they feel like they already had their shot i know it sounds silly but a lot of people both men and women think this way and if you dont go along with it youre often seen as weirdyou dont have to agree with me but this is an actual thingsounds like its a personal problemits a joke man relaxif you read the whole thread it is in context of the comment i was responding toowhen someone makes a claim out of the blue the onus is on them to prove theyre not full of shit not on me to prove they arenot at all i am perfectly capable of admitting im wrong in the face of undeniable proof i know thats a reddit rarity if you have a reputable study that proves this figure ill be glad to lookacceptablepopsif you have sex every chance you get you are going to end up being a rapist to not rape people you must decline to have sex with them when they cannot consentif a yr old has a crush on you and attempts to seduce you you dont have sex with them because they cannot consent someone below the age of consent cant consent easy and simple stay away from the moral gray areas and stay away from prison try to get away with things and prison is there to clarify for everyone that they crossed the line drunks are treated as if they were yrs old if you get drunk you get treated like a yr old until you get sober that is as simple as i can make iti dont even know what that means lol you seem like a creepwheres the funny partone of manydid you even read the study you linked is there something im missing as far as i can tell this study doesnt come anywhere close to supporting what you said in your original comment there was literally person out of that reported that they didnt remember their crime at all another said they didnt remember some element of the crime but many of these boil down to i thought i only stabbed him times but there were two stabs i dont remember or i remember punching him but not kicking him beyond that this study was only people only young violent offenders and only ukwales im not saying its not statistically significant but its also a far cry from this applies to all prisoners and not even in the same ballpark as of prisoners dont remember their crimesi will fully admit that i didnt read every single word of this study because well i have better things to do with my saturday if there is something i missed please point me to the section that supports your statement side note quoting google ai in your edit is not a good way to get people to take you seriously it might be right but its flatout wrong often enough that you should not be taking anything it says at face value without fact checking

touch the balleasy mjbrunsonandrea igoudalasurprised i havent seen denzel valentine mentioned yetanthony edwards khris middletonderrick whitelukakd or lukahonestly jokic very very very close nd is shaithe thing is they always look like theyre getting the shot they want obviously players play phenomenal defense against them but with shai with his footwork and elite push offs that he knows how to take advantage of and jokics elite knowing you know that he knows where everyone is on the court so you cant hard double even for a split second but also hes so tall if you dont double he knows how to get a good shot off with his high release pointtheyre just both so unguardable i really hope we get another series between them next playoffs theres a reason theyre both easily the best players in the league definition of unstoppableedit i know you said active players but im assuming you mean active players with how they are today if you mean active players in their prime then its lebronkdkawhiin general curry or honestly i kind of think brunson hes got seconds to put his defender in the torture chamber and hes a good enough pt shooter anyway may not be backed up statistically but it feels like he has the penchant for bs shotmaking against the blazers specifically draymond green lol he hasnt needed to own them for quite some time now but this guy has had several crazy performances moments against portland hes probably not hitting a three or converting an and in that situation but draymond turns into magic james against the blazers in the playoffs so it cant be ruled outluka or halimario elie damn near impossible to get a clean look in the last few seconds of a game unless youre damian lillard and you pull up from feet before the defender can can get a hand up give me dameif the martians got the death beam pointed at us ill turn the ball over so iguodala can save humanitylukalebronandre iguodalakyrie irving has ice water in his veins and zero fear in taking that shot im a

still kyriehalilebral horford that dude has never missed a key shot in his life at least against teams im rooting for cash moneyim gonna play it safe and say prime lebron he would definitely bully

healedlots of comments here dont know how clutch he was before getting injuredits funny because i hate his contested sidestep threes as much as anyone but apparently tatum is statistically one of the best clutch scorers but since he is on my team it wouldnt be himso i will go with haliburton since wed see him more then stephthe slim reaperkdsurprised no ones saying kdas a pelicans fan its devin booker he once had points in three games against the pelicans scoring each timepistons blake griffincurrently playing jokic hes either not getting doubled and getting a high percentage close range shot to tie and hope you dont foul on and and or you double him and hes finding the wide open three you pick your poison both options are badas a celtics fan steph fucking curryluka or kyrieman what if they played togetherwould be a great clutch teameasy curry because with a you losecarmelo anthony what he did to the bulls taj gibson and that other guy whom i can not remember but mans walked up and hit two buzzer beaters from the same spot one to send it to overtime and the other to ice the game from the hash at that and this was before curry had extended the pt linemichael jordanits gotta

perimeter without fouling and letting them drive to the rim with some resistancethen its the same situation but its better for my teamhaliburton should be the only answer after this last postseason

nightmaresbased on the last playoffs hali is a fucking problemas a rockets fan i have to say scott fosterkobeeeeelebron he can beat you himself or set a teammate up to take an open shot halliburtoni know the haliban doesnt look intimidating but unless your team has faced him in the playoffs theres nothing more nerve wracking than being up with seconds to go also nerve wracking for pacer fans too ngl kyrie harden hali and sga they will create or get to the lineprobably luka hes the best tough shot maker in the league right now i would have said jokic but that air ball against the clippers that ag was lucky to get his hands on is still very clear in my mindthey renamed my city after himlebron hes either driving it and making it or getting the foul atleast or hitting a mid range jumperits always lebron any other answer is just trying to be cutelebron but the most clutch player right now is jalen brunsonsga because it means we traded sgacurry is the only correct answer i

me iguodalathis is an old one but when i was younger it was luke walton i did not have the full context at the time that he was sort of basketball royalty and we had sort of a pseudobronny precursor situation going on but i just had the thought that things would generally go poorly he was a decent passer and made stuff happen sometimes but put the fear in meigoudalanas reid vs the warriorsbig shot bobcurrycurry is houston rockets father still lebron you never forget your dadcurry luka lebronrobert horryaka big shot roblillardeven though hes older now i wouldnt want to see steph holding for the last shothes squirrely enough that even if he doesnt hit the he may get the defender to foul himalso would not want to see a healthy haliburton with the ball eitherjamal murraylukadame even with one achilleslukajokicif its at the garden then anyonebest player of all time lebronharden for me in his rockets days every damn shot just seemed to be either money or a foulquick forwards can get away with being physical to curry harden just sell those so well most of the time fucking crafty too plus with capela either running downhill or waiting down low hes just so deadlyall time larry bird or steph lebron maybe not anymore lillard from two years ago not sure why people are saying kobe statistics arent on your side with him one of the worst clutch shooters in historycurry was my gut response but im actually more afraid of curry running around and separating for a catchandshoot than i am of him dribbling down the clocki gotta say sga dude is gonna get a shot off and either get an and for the gamewinner or two free throws to send it to otdude said currently playing and these cats are saying robert horry and steve kerr lol ill answershai thunder up sgamichael jordan is the only serious answer here as boring as it is he had ridiculous career clutch numbers fg in final seconds of playoff games goahead attempts with multiple iconic makes no one combined shot creation and shotmaking like mjbird is a clear but distant secondlebron is a bad answer for people saying him hes afraid to drive because if he gets fouled he is not a good free throw shooter he isnt a great pt shooter if you want to win it i could see him looking to pass which isnt great with only seconds leftmj kobe or kdkareemreggie millerim sure any raptors fan is saying lebron right now lolidc what no one says james muthaphuckin harden will cross over dribble hit his patent step back pump fake get the ball stripped out of his hands while simultaneously flop only to watch ref watch the defender dribble away with the ball and drain the dagger point shot to end the series to continue his longest streak of choking when it matters most he will not show up to the post series interview because he has to make it to the club first to pop that champagne to celebrate his streak in fashionhonestly anyone except paolo or franzalltime is more fun and its robert horry nothing is more intimidating than a points per game dude becoming the clutchest player in the biggest moments also that pain hurts more than jordanbroncurryany superstar beating you because theyre the best to ever do itcurrently do itbron kobe or jordanwestbrookedit oh i misread that as your teamshaiall time jordancurrent shaifrom a celtics fansteph lukakawhispidahaliare the that would make me shit myself if i saw them bringing

defend him the refs will give him ftsmpj is a god vs the lakers he has had me ranking him wayyyyyyyyy to high before for this seriesjamal murray also just plays and shoots x better whenever its the lakersyouuuuu fucking assholedefensefuck youuuuuuuuuuuuurudy fuckin gay manclicked to make sure this was the top comment carry onnooo not rudy gay nooohow has no one else posted the rudy gay kills boromircontextfuckin roody gay manspeaking of people killing the rapsjeremy lamboh no its rudy gay not this guythis gives me lifeis this a reference im missingwas about to to say this lolhes done jack shit in the playoffs somehow become relevant years later because of one videothat fucking guy would suck for minutes then hit the most clutch shots in the last minutethat fuckin guy smdhto be fair both him and jokic lots of crazy clutch moments the last few yearsda blue arrowoh geez crushing souls for years runningthose moments were the most demoralized ive felt as a fanif youre a lakers guy its hilarious watching people say how much jokic carries murray like yeah dude has his shortcomings but thats the same guy that averaged on in the wcf vs youor jokicthis has gotta be every laker fans answerreal laker fans know its tim thomasnaz reid too clutch shots in the post season this year aint even recency bias thats fucking insane for player lmaoim scared even if were up by with seconds left and hali has itnobody talks about it but the pacers playoffs were awesome only lost to the celtics by an average of points or somethingthe haliban clutch highlight reel is legendarythats not recency bias thats some goat shit like lebron shitone hundred fucking percentthis is the answer aaron gordon for similar reasonsi was resigning myself to a loss when he had the ball in game and rightfully so cause he drilled that jumper hes actually terrifyingi mean the amount of game winning buzzer beaters he did in one post season run is crazy thats not luck at that point he just has a knack for itapparently if he gets dribbles exactly it is impossible for him to missyeah that dude has a magnet inside the last seconds fri wonder what the vegas odds on him hitting a post season game winner for next year are you got to think he gets doubled as of please keep him away from the ball the last secondsha two separate times i was be messaging my friends in the fourth quarters about how halliburton felt completely invisible in the fourth and was adding almost nothing to a big pacers comeback and then hed hit a wild game winner just a few minutes after i hit sendi think this really is the answer thoughthe martians have the death beam pointed at earth you better hit itjokes aside he was always insanely clutch for us despite being a below average shooterthis devil named curry is killing usstephs pull up from near half court to steal the game from the thunder is iconicfrom experience damian lillardfrance would say the sameid rather have iguodala tbheasily that man is a damn aimbotkhris middletondefinitely worked in that last olympic gold medal gamefrom experience ray allenim very surprised this isnt the top commentidk if hes done something wild against yall but curry is one id love to take that last shot he usually doesnt hit go ahead clutch shotsdoesnt he have an abysmal clutch fgcurry literally had this scenario like twice before in the finals and clanked it theres many others i would be more scared ofwho hasnt thought they were winning and dribbled out the clockwhy i oughtai thought we were aheadthis is the answer seconds of perfect defense only for a catapult fade away to hit nothing but netwho is worse for lakers fans jokic or murrayor murray man lol its not talked about cause it didnt matter but this is one of the craziest oneshed probably clown the defense and make an insane pass for an easy dunk or wide open he doesnt even need to take the last shotbig shot bob he doesnt even need the full seconds someone just needs to knock the ball out to him at the three point line with seconds left and its going inhorry im fine with seconds left sec fuck outta heregreatest clutch point shooting percentage in playoff history its like fucking legendshhhhas a pistons fan i agree f this dudeif i needed a shot to win a game i would pick michael jordan if i needed a shot to save my life i would pick larry bird pat rileyiguodalathe funny thing with dame is hell just take the so often hes obviously got way more than his fair share of buzzer beating jump shots but a lot of the time hes just driven to the hoop because plan a is so obvious that people just have to play him too tightly double ot game was nutsdamn that feels like ages agoruis a snipergetting him for nunn and two seconds is an extremely underrated great move from robrui doing the whoop that trick you fucking assholenot this guyluka magicthis makes me sadi believed i this duocrazy i had to scroll this far to get to kd he might be my number choice just give him the ball and get out of the waykobe doesnt belong on that listthis comment is too god damn lowjamaal sighs christ ok uhh well what well do ill run in first uhgather up all the eggs we can kinda just ya know blast them all down with aoe um i will use intimidating shout to kinda scatter em so we dont have to fight a whole bunch of them at once uhh when my shouts are done ill need anfrony to come in and drop his shout too uh so we can keep them scattered and not to fight too many um when his is done bas of course will need to run in and do the same thing uhwere gonna need divine intervention on our mages uhh so they can ae uh so we can of course get them down fast cause were bringing all these guys i mean well be in trouble if we take them down quick uhh i think this is a pretty good plan we should be able to pull it off this time uhh what do you think abduhl can you give me a number crunch real quickabduhl uhhh yeah gimme a sec im coming up with thirtytwo point three three uh repeating of course percentage of survivaljamaal uhthats a lot better than we usually do uhh alright you think were ready guys interruptedleeroy alright chums im back lets do this leerooooooooooooooooooooy jeeeeeenkiiiiiiiiiiins runs into rookeryklay is an interesting onethe current lakers killerlearned from damewhat about mj hes a toe shortthis is my answer too always been irrationally afraid of himsorry hes not on the flooronly answer so far that will make the pass that kills you playoff game winners against the pacersits weird that no one else said lebron he is literally statistically speaking the most clutch player in nba historyfound max kellermans reddit altdepends on who hes got money ondont forget his crazy end of game jumpers during his second cavs stintsga isnt getting nearly enough love in this threadas a spot up shooter and nonstar i mean danny green was up there too but hes thankfully retiredto answer the real question shai great size and athleticism with elite handle and shot making the heir apparent to kawhi but blessed with better health knock on woodmax kellerman is that youlebrontoclipper fans close your eyesno thats just a trauma responsemax you coming back to espn or fsisnt lebron horrendous on game winnersonly if you are also playing against ray allenbecause when other basketball players say kobe im just going to believe themits pretty funny looooolsga is a good answerhow is that a serious answer the question is about current players lolbruhdude was insane in the seriesthankfully hes gone now cant wait for cam j to be the next lakers killer also bruce who played well against us in is back nowfuck yes usernamedamn a yearold account toorbeetlejuicingoh no its rudy gay nooooonoone is sending the vid so here you go this guy if he hadnt sucked for the first minutes the clutch shots wouldnt have been necessary because itd have been a blow out alreadyall this while he hasnt played in the entire season due to injury but somehow hes healthy nowyeah but jokic aint much you can do he does that to everyonemurray sees the lakers and turns into a monsteryeah jokic hitting his turn around one foot flamingo fadeaway three with under one second on the clock over the outstretched hand of anthony davisfuck tim thomas lakers coulda won it all that yearhaliburton had more clutch playoff moments in a single run than most players mentioned in this thread had in their careerif youre the defense you literally want the ball in anybody elses hand as long as its not the fucking halibanhalis run was generationalone of the must enjoyable runs for a player and a team ive seen as a neutralif theres ten seconds left in the game you give it to haliburton that man was pulling off a death star trench run every series hes guided by the forceas an lal fan i was telling friends watching the playoffs to be terrified of himhes done something no other player has ever donemjcould be with second and somehow im still scaredmake it up seven with seconds left thats this mfers sweet spotas a celtics fan i am convinced it would have been games if hali had been healthy last year and i am not sure if we would have won probably but not sureoddly enough they might have had more trouble with dallas than we hadyaaay ag got his flowers thxi dont know man he may be out for iti do want to make this movie not space jam but a real independence day in tone alien movie where the aliens come down and make a weird situation where we have to assemble a basketball team to save earth i think its so stupid people would like itwhen max kellermen said his statement i didnt even think it was that hyperbolic the dude did the most clutch shit against the cavs every finals run every time the cavs looked like they were about to go on a run in this dude came in and hit two s and strip a player to take the gas out of the crowdhe was a master of stripping the ball from shooters that steal on dame was insaneall time commentarystop reminding me pleasethe craziest part of that shot being so memorable is it was a regular season game at the end of februaryand dame pulling up on pgthey do have a time outfrom experience either one guessokc the franchise hit with the two most iconic three point buzzer beaters of the decadefinally someone said ituh no lmaoyoure getting down voted but him and kd are the ones id most want to take that last shot because they usually missevery player has moments when they dont deliver for every game against cavs or game against toronto stephs got game against cavs and game against celtics where he was the ernie offense and hit big shotsdownvoted for a literal factual statement lol he probably had more than two chances considering how long the game was tied at somehow got locked up by kevin love with the game on the linethe one he hit over ad in game of the wcf hurtfuckyoukicthreecatapult fade is so accurateboth seem to feast on the lakers its been a loselose situation for usyesin the final moments its murray hes prime mj against the lakers in the last two minutes overall its definitely jokic tho so i guess bothjokic is at least always great and entertaining to watch murray only shows up against us so murraythe one from denverhes hit like of those against the lakersshit derek fisher didnt even need a half secondwhyd i even click on this post lmaohello from san anton wait fuckif i need a shot to save my life im taking ben simmonsthis quote sounds cool but still doesnt make any sense lmao quadruple otwhat a casualbro lol the disrespect from these kidsokay nephewklay always keeps his team in contention for games when theyre down in the playoffs andor facing elimination game klay exists for a reason klay is the only reason why warriors won game kept the warriors in contention for game in the nba finals klay is a king of positioning himself can certainly get ready to make the shot if needed for gsw truth be told no way im trusting steph when hes consistently letting gsw down in elimination games in the nba finalsactually his foot is too talllongthat was cold blooded in my dave chappelle rick james voiceits points lolloldoesnt he have the most playoff game winners in nba history or somethingyeah it is hilarious im still howling lolwaiting for a craig hodges name drop you added that in as an edit for current players the answer is durant with an honorable mention for damedont carethe lakers fans nuggets fear is palpable in this thread i also thought he did it for the lols he did not rudy really did it to him that badhavent seen this in foreverdefense de nooooo its rudy gayhahahaha damn i completely forgot about this clip appreciate the linkfair but i would respectfully like to ask him to commit to the part and suck the full minutes its the hope that kills uslast season the knicks did a great job forcing it out of his hand late in the shot clock only for nembhard to hit the most fucked pointer ive ever seen other than a jokic pacers are too clutch outside of the boston serieswish he never got hurt it was magicalnot a neutrali disagreetyrese doesnt use his targeting computerhey man youll never find me shitting on ag i was simply impressed by him that series mr nugget seems right to call himis flopping allowedflair checks outthat was no regular regular season though warriors were on a start to the season and this was the final game of a game roadtrip this was the th game in days for the dubs despite being on fumes steph had literally gone from deep the previous game against magic thunder were putting it together though and were on a games stretch at that point thunder had just recently lost to the dubs earlier in the month and were seething for revenge every team in the league wanted to shut down the warriors party of a newcoach young team with a newly minted superstar making a fool of the league despite all this thunder were leading for most of the game and warriors were barely clinging on dubs were down points deep into clutch time heck dubs were down points with seconds to go dubs needed a lastsecond dumb foul on iggy to even take it to ot steph was on a heater and this was the game he broke his own record for most s in an nba season threes kd fouled out for the first time in years at that point warriors looked to be on the ropes throughout the game but came away with the win and then they did have a timeoutto have an iconic game at that point in the season shows you were cant miss tvdas a bad shot idcdecide not to use ithoustonsamethis is from a few seasons ago curry just has more than the average all starthat was the one where ad just started laughing because wtf can you even dothere was the one in the bubble too wish that one actually counted for somethinggrowing up in sas im very conflicted about this threadhell yeah mr himselfthat shot was the ultimate dagger to the heartone lucky shot deserves anothermakes sense you dont need him to make the shot to save your lifemichael jordan wouldnt care enough to save someones life to make the shot but if it was a game he does not want to loseits about their attitudes in playing the game mj only cared about winning the game bird played more like it was life or death theres no fault in either viewpointkobestans are the fucking nephewsyeah gimme prime klay in an elimination game down for literally the entire game end of a normal game tied series etc probably someone else but klay has had insane performances down and i know it wasnt an elimination game but steph had arguably his best game when the dubs were down in bostonif they lost that game the series is basically overthe post was asking about game but if its game i understandmy favorite so far is mark priceahh i see you just dont talk about current basketball at least got lebron dall i can think of is that he flew too close to the sun and angered the gods jealous spiteful assholes they arethey won of he doesnt get hurt imo thunder looked shook until hali injurylmaolet the hate floooow through youhes such a likable guy while i am a nuggets fan so obviously i like him i used to hate him on the magic because he seemed like a hothead idk if that opinion was right or not and now he seems like the most humble and genuine dude aroundp sure its widely agreed upon now thats its a bad shot lol but when ur dame ur dameits a bad shot but it was also dame timecurry way downtownyepthat was during his slump and it was only on attemptsfisher horry ray allen marbury sighs certified spurs killersfinally something i have in common with an nba playerif he passes off and never actually takes a shot then youre immortali think its more bird is a better shooter and the lifesaving shot isnt against a defense but i like your explanation better so thats canonthats actually brilliant loli interpret the quote as riley doesnt care about a game as much as his life his egolakers history means he cant ride with larry but when his back is against the wall hes the guyfuck them kidsthis has nothing to do with being a kobestan he was statistically one of the most clutch players in nba history the guy hit like game winners in one seasonyeah steph has incredible games great performances in the playoffs however steph should almost never be trusted w the last shot in the playoffs this dude has made so many bad playsmissed shots historically its almost impossible for me to trust him unironically over a dude like igoudala who is actually clutch or klay thompson lol as an okie that name actually hits he was player of the year in oklahoma out of enid hshave no idea why he went to tech still waiting on like batum or abdulraef hali was going for before he got hurt and no amount of social media comments can convince me otherwise we truly were robbed of an all time gdame got massive balls the amount of shit he wouldve gotten if that didnt went in but when its dame time its overbang bangthis is from the most recent season and if you sort by descending fg his name disappears from the first pagehorry also a spurs hero and championhe was colllllllllld he is veryyyyyyyyy underrated because of white however chatgpt cant even find a game winner for him in the nbahe looked like a fucking killer at the start of the game truly one of the most unfortunate injuries to ever happen in the sport denying us a legendary game in the finalsoh what a shot from curryhe won clutch player of the year last year idk what to tell you lolyour list gobert over kawhi and you wanna post that shit with a straight facedang',\n",

acl mcl completely he was talkin about how he was gna been in a wheelchair watchin his girl take it best dawgs like this well if you call up the guy who got traded from the same city think its naturally pretty funnythat is literally what all homies do loldemar probably had a bad case of depression brain which causes you to feel extra lonely and worthless and rudy who is by all accounts well adjusted has a more grounded view of the situation which is youre still a gainfully employed youngish dudeit really depends on the friend and dynamic id be pissed if the person i expected to be my emotional stability laughed at me for sure but if my goofball friend laughed id probably laugh too sometimes you need that friend that will make you laugh when you dont want toohey bro you know me and lilianwe getting a divorce years man bro ahahahahahaits not funny man she wants to keep the dogbro oh word hahahahawhythat makes me question youyou probably wasnt raised by a manbruh is they trading people in ymca league at midnight please stfu nobody is trading your old ass for nothingpussynot just that they talked for hours lmao they were really close demar talked about it and drake as well i understand hes musics public enemy number one but demar switching up on drake was funny to seehe didnt burn any bridgesdemar has already said he still considers drake a friend and drake said hed tear down any banners raised to demar but he was smiling while he said iti promise you that when toronto raises a banner for demar or lowry or whatever youre gonna see drake demar hanging out laughingdamn a lot of these nba pods are like this lol steve nashlebron james gotta have a few bucks kicking around and their pod looks like something i could put together and you dont want me to do that then i listen to some mountain biking podcasts way way less money involved that are struggling to make it work funding their own show sometimes and the sound quality is a million times better i can have the volume turned up half as loud why is this do they just not care enough think whatever im famous as fuck so people will watch either wayman rudy in nba k was lebron james for a guy like rudy gay getting traded is just part of the businessno the entire nba is a business its only about money they dont give a shit about fans or players or legacy they want to sell ads look how they treated jordan can you imagine a team looking to fuck over a talent like jordan but it happened because moneyyou just start watching basketballhe absolutely was in memphisyou telling on yourselffucking rudy gay mannnwasnt he playing for sa at the time toohe did a interview on a podcast recently with rudy gay and melo thats why these clips are being postedthank god drake has you here to defend himyea but drakes taylor swift for men soim sure theres a story youve told a bunch of times for the sake of conversation comments complaining about demar always talking about it and youre the first person to understand that he gets asked this question every minutesyeahisnt the rest of the thread talking about how he grew up in comptongets asked a question answers questionyouall the boners downvoting dont realize that this dude shows up twice a year on some random podcast to complain about this same old thing that happens years agono one else has ever complained about being traded as much as this guyhe was very open about how much he loved toronto and wanted to be there long term he was the rare all star that was fully committed to toronto i get why it would hurt his feelings to get tradedpeople are generally going to share their own experiences on a topic when the point of the segment is to share your experiences about a given topicwhat wordyou not slickgoogle returns no pertinent results for eli beer carmelo what are you talking abootunless youre asiani remember that lol he said thats how its pronounced because thats how his mum said it so anyone pronouncing it the normal way was wrong completely disregarding that accents exist loloh no its rudy gayfuckin rudee gay manshits hilarious he already knew they were about to get cooked by rudy gaymy personal favorite lotr version i lose my shit every single time goddamn those were dark timesnot this guyim fully invested in gay islandnot this guycousins favors gay love sessionstoday i feel gayand torontos success also kicked up a notch when he got traded it was like a pokemon evolution of the gay trade lol trade an inefficient mid range chucker fleece your trade partner tbf this is kinda sad cause they fleeced patfo during some of pops most turbulent period reach unprecedented levels of team successnot just that rudy knows the pit of despair toronto has sent him toyeah being wayadministrative s friend sounds boringtoodemar bro these traded merudy gay first timeone time i was playing soccer with friends and one of them tore his acl instead of waiting for an ambulance to come and take him to the hospital i drove my volkswagen polo onto the pitch making ambulance sounds out the windowpoor guy was crying in pain and laughing at the same time as we loaded him into my car i agree with you lmaoit also kind of makes you feel better a little bit if your brother isnt too concerned about it maybe you shouldnt be eithergainfully employed is bit of an understatement this dude has created generational wealth for his familythats probably the best way to handle it laugh at the bullshit eventually youll laugh togetherthats why its a positive story he tells later snapped him out of his funk with the audacitydemar and kendrick did go to high school together to be fairunless something happened between drake and demar to create that rift before the kendrick stuff that made me lose a lot of respect for demarto switch up on a friend and pile up on him because you want to be with the cool kids is just so fking lamewell if drake hadnt beefed with someone from compton demar probably wouldve left him alone dude went to dominguez hes not choosing some canadian vs an actual homiewhats fucked up is demar switched up for the clout and public image not that he cares about what drake actually did a lot of nba players dont give a shit about that or kobeor karl malone wemby is the exceptiontheres a reason why we have the leaders we do today rndrake wasnt smiling when he said that he seemed semidrunk and genuinely pissed and they banned him from broadcasts after that demar said he considered drake a friend but dude went out of his way to cameo in the music video of a hit song that straight up calls him a pedophile that was played as nauseum for like half a year everywhere i highly doubt drake laughs that off hes mad at lebron for just being at the pop out show let alone on stage dancing let alone in the music video staring direct to camera as kendrick flames him toronto raises a banner for demarlol that shit is not happening gangrudy shoots on game winningtying shots under s hes ranked on high volume steph is shooting gay is just gayback when rudy gay base on any jumpshotmyteam card made it instantly goatedfunny you say that think in k or k the one before the heatles existed the miami heat signed him during the summer of in my mycareer had a thriftstore version of the big with him michael beasley youre not wrong and i dont think thats in conflict to what i saidthey made the playoffs once in his full seasons with them and he never made an all star team good player but never a bus driverhe was also just off that cusp of becoming a superstaruhhh what bus was he driving the short onerudy gay was nice but he was never one of those guys lets be real no all star appearanceshe wasnt decent for a memphis squad that sucked until gasol and conley came into their ownwhy are you bringing this up when they immediately got much better and had way more success after trading him i was watching then too and i agree with him rudy gay was a bus driver the same way monta ellis was a bus driverhaha yes and he said he laughed again when he told him where he was traded tofunnily enough thats actually kendrick lamarfuckin asshole answering the questions he gets askedyeah man what word are you talking aboutweird i couldnt find it on youtube either unless im hallucinating a wholeass commercial i think it was for corona or some such beer and went something like eli melo sitting courtsideeli this is great awesome athletes getting bucketsmelo murmurs assenteli you know what would would make this even bettermelo turns scornful you gon say a bucket of corona arent you eli bashful nostadium waiter appears your bucket of corona mr manningmelo chuckling oh you think you slick you not slickwtfdefinitely the first time i have ever heard that name said that wayyou fucking assholeyou fucking assholeman i miss those days lolone of my favorite pissed off tommy heinsohn calls while rudy was hitting big shots against us he may be gay but nobodys laughing right nowi took those winning seasons for granted back then plus stumbling in the playoffs every time left a bitter aftertaste but man it really was a great time to be a raptors fan those regular seasons were so fun to watch and the teams we had were so easy to cheer for if ingrams health holds up im cautiously optimistic that well see a resurgence this year bc the last few have been roughdont think it was a fleece its pretty crazy how much the spurs got flipping the little we got from the raptors ended with like first rounders for poetl and derozan which eventually helped get fox kawhi was pretty much an unknown legit hadnt talked to anyone about how his health was and teams were worried how much hed even play the raptors ended up being the best offer while keeping the team competitive we just got really unlucky with dejounte tearing his acl and missing demars entire first seasonthe only word in inefficient midrange chucker that fits derozan is midrangepatfoit wasnt a fleece the raps got kawhi at a bargain because they were the only team willing to match their demand for a one year rental spurs knew kawhi was gone but they called his bluff on anywhere but here and they damn sure werent going to gift him to la for scrapstrading the gay guy from your team makes them better dont let the red hats hear this syou probably saved your buddy a lot of money tooshiiit agreedyeah i know everybody gets depressed but demar gotta count his blessings lmao take some prozac and go to therapy i know that nba healthcare is on pointkendrick went to high school with arron afflalonah they went to rival schoolsdifferent schools on the other side of comptoni do agree lebron and demar are completely at fault in that situation you dont do that to your friend everbut to be deeply involved that make you lose respect to one of them even tho both parties dont even know your existence thats too deeptheres a difference between a friend having a fight with someone and a friend fighting his hometown and his family drake might have been a good friend but you gotta pick a side and any self respecting person is not choosing a friend over familymy cents its also why steph said he rides with drake drake is semi familyrelated to ayeshas side or something like that it aint that big of a deal theres fallout when shit goes downmy cents demar also never spoke down on drake at allas a person who lived in compton even i consider what demar did as a betrayal demar had a third option which was to stay out of it i dont think he understood the ramifications of being in nlufam i hear you but in that case it wasnt just some canadian thats what im saying they obviously have some shit to unpack that i dont care for not my business lol but its disingenuous to think that their relationship was surface level where all indications between the two pointed at a friendship that went leftbro it was his actual friend he wasnt just some canadian to derozan kendrick didnt even fw him like that he just knew it was a dig at drake and derozan was too stupid to see it this is evidenced by his backtracking afterwardsdo you not think people and circumstances change in so many yearsthis is so weirdbro i dont think you can compare drake to karl malone like that not even to what giddey did is getting retired no doubtnooooo not this guyhe was a bad bus driver but he was allowed behind the wheel in memphiseven pos busses need a drivermore of a tank commander than a bus driverthats irrelevant he was star of the franchise it shows the scholarship of this sub that you had over idiots agree with youthat guy didnt know thatthis sub has an obscene level of basketball ignorancemaybe doesnt change that he drove itwho gives a fuckhe was still the star of the teamso what he was the star of the franchise i dont give a damn if they were badthe guy claimed that rudy gay never had a franchiseand he absolutely did i didnt know what he was talking about and its sounding like you dont eitherthere was only one trade anyone was watching for at that moment it wasnt even a questionfunnily enough that makes zero senseboth fanbases are god awful and delusional fans of artists who havent put out good music since my first year in highschoolim canadian though so the drake has always been so much worseyou werent it was all over the playoffs ads last yearok i think i know what youre talking about and also experienced this its wild its been wiped from the net i just did my damndest to find iti think hes referencing jeremy linfuckin rudy gay manfuckinn rudy gay manwellwish they stuck around a few more years couldve got insert colour dick gay love sessionskawhi wasnt as much an unknown but more so wasnt playing again for the spurs and he made it clear he was going to la when his contract expired spurs had leverage and every team trading for him was doing so under the impression it was likely a year rental there was very little trade value relative to his talent because his uncle was shouting from the heavens that he was not playing for the spurs and that he was signing with an la team the following yearhe didnt start shooting efficiently until his second year in sas he was below average from the field his entire raptors career and only managed to scrape league average ts his last two years by hitting the lineand in the playoffs he was abysmal especially his ts for his career is in the playoffs just barely what revisionist bullshit is thisgo check derozans midrange numbers with toronto most of his nonrim attempts are from feet up to the three point line and his most efficient year was and that was a third of his field goal attemptshe only started to fix his mid range diet during his last year in toronto when he finally started to attempt more from the ft area feethes inefficient especially in the playoffsnot exactly lolpopandthefrontofficewhy bring politics into a basketball forum was this necessarydont let the fact i called it soccer fool you im from the uk thankfully thats not something we have to worry abouthe was the one to followdidnt realize he knew jcole for that longas a hip hop purist ive been critical of drake his entire career but even a broken clock is right twice a dayas far as i know demar and kendrick were never close like that the fact that he switched up on drake just cause k dot is from his city is some whack west coast tribalism and snake behaviourfor what choking and bringing the team down multiple times in the playoffs and whining about how we would have won if lebron was on our team toothe only other jersey being retired is number the scholarship of this sub like were peer reviewing clinical studies in here lololwe must have different definitions of bus drivers and thats cool he was the star of the franchisemarc gasol zach randolph would like a wordjust watch the video manyall motherfuckers are not good at googling things corona tv spot buy a bucket featuring eli manning carmelo anthony ispot would never have got that lol is that a common acronym literally never seen it before and im on here way too muchoh lol thats right i forget the rest of the world isnt quite as insane when it comes to health care costsamericans when they find out youre not getting a lifelong debt when you go to the hospital in the most parts of the world ahhhhhh shit thats crazy bruh yall get health care we get deported whole time trying to tell the ice guy i was born in long beachhow barbaric of you over here in the godfearing land of the free weuhhdivide everything by or and were mostly all broke please someone helpnah derozan and drake were close at one point but you have to really be a hater to believe he wasnt just close to kendrick too there are interviews from where derozan talks about how he and kendrick are friends and how their shared childhood environment shaped themdrake switch up all the time doe we dont know what happened behind closed doors once demar wasnt playing for the rapsid switch up on my friend if i found out theyre a pedophilehow is that any worse than being cool cause you played in the same city either way not too serious drake had bronnow sga tat and he was at the pop up showremovedtoronto mans crashing out you may not personally like him for whatever reasons but i find it more likely than not that mlse would choose to retire his jerseyword too big for youyeah yours is wrongsmhbet you thought you were cookingyou know gay was on the team for more than one season right geniusfuck outta hereseriously i googled eli manning carmelo anthony beer commercial and this was the very first result if the user above truly did their damndest to find it and couldnt i fear for their wellbeing out in the world on their owntis the king of the internetjust watched the commercial carmelo anthony doesnt even look at the beers manning sheepishly has the servant place them on the empty seat next to him mind you a court side seat the caronas get their own courtside seat carmelo acted too cool for coronas and the manning well he isnt really shown drinking any caronas eitheralso seems embarrassed that carmelo caught him being slick maybe is manning even going to drink the beers now why would carmelo ever after all that what sort of commercial is this why is no one drinking caronas i forget the rest of the world isnt quite as insane when it comes to health care costsftfy only one country locks its people into lifealtering debt to receive healthcare it is insane and no other countries provide financial ruination for your family because you broke your leg and need a transport b treatmentwtf do the crips and bloods have to do with this situation you gonna be loyal to every motherfucker from your city just cause hes from your city demar admitted he cried to drake and shit when he was suicidal youre a clownhow many years do you think that gay led the griz in win sharesill tell you the answer is definitely just tried searching for it on tiktok and then youtube and when neither of those worked just called it a dayhonestly of commercials wished someone like you would spend this much time thinking about it deep analysis over a commercial xdyoure not allowed to drink alcohol in any ad for it in the uscanada youll literally never see anyone take a sip at most theyll only ever hold itare by chance artisticexactly theyre always softening how incomprehensible and ludicrous it actually is i even used big words that id never use because americans are actually getting fucked and think its alright no lube or sweet talking eitherim a clown lol do you know anything about hip hop do you know anything about compton do you know anything about kendrick and demar lol they are both crip affiliated and grew up in a place that was basically controlled and policed by the crips its actually well known why these two guys from the same neighborhood would be friendly and have more loyalty than just two west coast guys but youre the hip hop purist rightonce again so whathe was the first optionhe did more work than needed and still couldnt find it i asked my metagpt headset and got nothing probably was wiped from the internetchatgpt or grok more likelythats the part that must really hurt americans are some of my favourite people ive met outstandingly funny hospitable warm generous people from the usbut america lost the plot when it comes to education and healthcare and i do feel sad for her people that just want to exist and growdo you fucking know anything about hip hop it started in a park in the bronx before the crips and bloods even got to ny its bigger then compton or the west coast or bloods and crips and what the fuck do the blood and crips have to do with drake because demar and kendrick are affliated so what it was a drake vs kendrick thing not a blood vs crips thing or drake vs crips thingi know plenty of motherfuckers from toronto i hate not gonna cross a friend for them he could have just stayed out of it like kawhi there was no reason for demar to choose a sidesimply being from the same city neighbourhood school we doesnt automatically earn you my loyaltyso what he wasnt the star of the franchise',\n",
       " 'he shot from feet to put that into perspective shai shot this past seasonlebron peaked at in giannis peaked at in shaq peaked at in obviously theres context for era and volume but regardless he was absolutely unstoppable when he got to the rimi remember his pt game being treated like ptsthis legit the craziest mixtape ive seenthat st pass is insaneits hilarious that people started to underrate luka after one yeari love this guy man really hope he wins a mvp and championship one daythats worth more than current ad and flaggi dont care whos around them i fucking hope the lakers and nuggets play each other in the playoffs and jokic and luka are fully healthydamn thats the nastiest shit ive ever seen surely nobody would trade this guywas called fat this season he couldve lost pounds or something but acting like was his whole career is so dumbhe doesnt need to be rookie year skinny get some muscle lose some fat like but even this tape would be really close to perfectplease dear lord do not let the lakers have thisrd in mvp by the way what a joke of a league and those who cover ithe shouldve won mvp they were a win team while entire team was dealing with injuries not to mention they didnt even have gafford and washington until later on in the season he got punished for being only games from the first seed despite luka having to carry the entire offenserobbed of mvp wins argument is bullshit considering those goal posts move on a yearly basisyeah uh holy shitnico saw this and decided that ad is better jesus christ some of those passes are unrealhe really doesnt look fat or slow dude got a bit of weight and slowed down after having notoriously dangerous and hard to heal calf issues and dallas immediately traded him lmao its so ridiculousdefinition of slow is smooth smooth is fastimagine trading this for nothing lmaoshouldve won mvp btwhes such an offensive weaponthank you nicoonly reason he was behind because nuggets and okc records mavs were ass at the beginning it was all jokic vs shai as both were fighting for seed mavs climbed back after the trade deadline to almost get the th seed but luka just didnt get into the convos as the goalpost kept moving thensigh that season will go down in history books as one of the best in the history of the nba and people voting for the mvp should be ashamed of themselfes shouldve been renamed to mnr media narrative award long time agothe very first pass is one of the best passes ive ever seenhow can people say with a straight face that sga is better than this guyive seen enough trade that manits still crazy mavs traded himop having aahhh thats really deep luka doncic be the end of the video is hilariousme seconds in what the fuckill never understand how he didnt win mvp that year jokic won because of great stats and more wins but then won in because his team was injured and he kept them afloat the exact same as luka that year except luka had why do the goalposts move for mvp every year shouldve been mvp jokic shouldve won year beforethat first pass is wild lmaoi love luka being impossible to stop unless when he is playing against my team probably the same as everyone here that feelings that the defense was great but didnt matter its like the guard version of jokicabsurd how easy he makes it looki hate that some people treat you like youre crazy for saying he shouldve won mvp this year he came fourth playing like this with a very injured team playing through injuries himselfim cool with jokic but its a and a i think the team being more competent offensively in the playoffs has stopped people from remembering dante exum was his for a monthand he wasnt even second on the mvp race that season he really did deserve it that year dude was putting up wilt numbers and took his team to the finalsnikola most oppressed mvp ever jokic fans are gonna act like they dont see thisi dont care who else may have deserved it more this season should have been the automatic mvp like westbrook got for his triple double dallas did way better as a team and actually went to the finals lukas mvp case this year is better than when westbrook wonfuck the dallas mavericksi miss you luka i hope once nico is fired and the team is sold that luka can come back to finish his career as a maverick like it was supposed tofirst player to get mvp fatigue before winning onelooked so much better in a mavs jerseybanana is not his colorthat first pass is absolute madness lolwe passed on this guy for bagley ill never let it goand th seed in the west when he had to carry half of the season because of the injuries mavs were probably the most injured team that year plus finals appearance after they were underdogs in every series not enough fot the mvp keep on moving the post nba mediathis is why i think well be contenders obviously made a few roster tweaks but getting prime luka fully motivated to unleash hell on the league with lebron as a running mate gives us an outside chance at the very leastrd in mvp voting dogshit league best player in the world that seasonadam silver needs to be in solitary confinement for not giving this young goat the mvp that yearnoticeably lighter and quicker than his seasonim certain he will be bubble luka weight going into this next season it took a trade from him to get his diet seriousi dont understand how anyone can think sga is a better player being on a stacked team really pays offrobbed of an mvpmvpthis season was really something elseits crazy to think he put up that stat line at that effiency and it wasnt worthy of an mvp award because jokic was just so fucking goated saw two of the greatest regular seasons of alltime imo from luka on ts and a preinjury joel embiid who put up on ts with elite defense the two of them were on another level in the reg culminating in that week where embiid gave wemby and i think luka also had his even that first play in the videoshould have won mvp that seasonsga finished over him in mvp voting btw please delete this thank you for your considerationreddit would lose their shit if larry bird didnt win mvpevery year if internet existed in the sdoes luka ever dunknico called this man a fat slob and traded himwhy are so many videos lately cut in a way the edges are off and you cant even see the whole playman this trade really fucked my fandom up i guess im a laker fan now but ive been a mav fan since kidd rejoined i hate sports sometimesniko saw this mf eat one doughnut and said hes gotta gono disrespect to anthony davis but i refuse to believe a gm and ownership willingly traded luka without shopping him around no one is that fucking stupid i would have instantly denied that trade in fantasy basketball nba k etc and im a fucking idiothow on earth did this dude get traded nico saw this and thought trade this mani hope he can top his point career high this seasoninsanei was amazed now it just makes me angrythey said he wasnt in shape because he was injured the last stretch of the regular season and the entire postseason and then got injured early last season and couldnt get in proper shape last season if they hadnt traded luka the mavs would be the only real competition for the thunder this season they built a perfect roster for the transcendental superstar and then traded him for scraps and got lucky on a coin flip he deserved mvp in and he deserved better than what nico did to him i will not get over it he was unbelievable to watch every nighthes great on the halfcourt but he drags the offense into halfcourt possesions and not push the ballhurts so bad if i was like the worlds dictator in a tyranny distopia i would do many important things but one of my first decisions would be to rescind the trade immediately force nico to resign and the ownership to sell the team one move killed years of my love for a franchisethank you nicothat first pass is absolutely wildtoo bad this mf will never look like this againrobbed of an mvphuh doesnt look fat to mea reminder to the goober jokic fans complaining about him not winning it this year last years mvp shouldve gone to luka by the same frankly correct standards of not valuing narratives and team success so lets call it even mkaystill cant believe he lost the mvp race that year just goes to show you how dominant jokic is totally insaneyeah hes alright but jokic doesnt even care about basketball he just wants to go home to his horses the greatest statistical season everreally shouldve won the mvp that yearpravi mvplets see the defense for this year luka is one of the best offensive players in nba history only steph and jokic are even in the same convo with himfor reference in luka ranked nd in fg on drives only giannis better on drives th in fg in the paint st in layup fg one of only players shooting over th in above the break p this doesnt sound very impressive but only two players that season shot more than above the break s steph and luka steph shot while luka shot you put all that together and you get a player who scores on drives like giannis scores in the paint like a center who never misses layups and shoots s like steph all while giving you assists per gamethis is a truly insane stati feel for the mavs fans who probably have just started accepting things how they are now and have moved on i mean the trade but they just keep seeing stats like thiscan he go from feet thoyep and the national media the next day was talking about if the defense is too weak these days that can be true but to not appreciate the performance was annoyingits crazy too with the clutch bucket to send it to overtime people underrate it because there was like three point games in like a month and the consensus was that the league was broken and it was too easy to score so people dont carebecause he played in dallas not la new york or bostonprobably didnt help that there was another point game the week before and a point game the same daysame stephen a spent his time discrediting the hawks on how bad they are instead of giving luka an ounce of creditand this doesnt even include the playoffsi wanna diethey traded this dude for ad max christie and pickno wonder hes called luka magic some of those shots and passes are nothing short of magicgo see derrick henry in high schoolyeah but defense wins championships go watch dawg in this thread theres people saying hes better offensively than lebron and championship one daymy love for luka is conflicted with hate for lakers not easy i can tell out thathe wasnt fat here tbf his weight got up after he got injured trying to drag his team to chip when everyone else stopped playing after wfc then last season they forced him to play though injuries and traded him after he wanted to fully heal before playinglakers fans act opressed for some reason lmaono offense but its a cluster fuck we have this sorry not sorryhes a victim of too good too early ppl expected a triple double every game from his second season on when he didnt do that and become a defensive player of the year he was overrated so dumbcrazy part is had embiids knee not died luka wouldve been fourth in the votingjoke of a commentjokic was much more efficient albeit on lower volume and recorded more assists on fewer turnovers he was also was pulling in times as many offensive rebounds per possession and had some of the most insane onoff splits in nba historyshai scored as much as luka per possession and did so more efficiently he did less playmaking but also fewer turnovers his defence was somewhere from good to very good while lukas was badall the publicly available rpmtype stats have jokic significantly ahead of luka and have luka and shai neckandneck worth noting that they mostly have embiid head and shoulders over luka as wellespecially since westbrook won it as the th seed with a worse record before which breaks that narrativewins argument is valid if its like this year where the mvp has more wins than the runner up last year jokic only had more wins while lukas team was crippled half the season and made major roster changes at the trade deadlineill say it again robbed of mvphe finished third broyou dont have to worry about that anymoreyeah im glad there are a fans who get it and he always chose to represent slovenia instead of rehabbing fully he carried hard for years straightimagine calling ad nothinghes like the white larry birdlast three mvps have all gone to the wrong people imoembiid giannisjokic lukashai giannisjokicjokic was far and away deserving of mvp that yearjokic is and was still better thenit made zero sense when sga finished ahead of luka in mvp voting during the seasononly okc fans think that shai is not a transcendent superstar like luka jokic giannis etceasilywatch luka try and play defense and youll understand its like comparing kobemj to hardenlmao its not even close genuinelylook at any advanced stats look at accolades shailukabecause defense is a part of basketballthe shai hate is so forced you cant stop yourself from bringing him up the first chanxe you get to shit on himbunch of losers go downvote this after you downvote the other people who said the same down belowi think a large big part of jokic winning because he embarrassed the voters the year prior when they didnt give him and he won the title they didnt want to go through that againluka finished third if not jokic it would have gone to sgasga had the better season by farwell it doesnt account for his calf injuries he suffered which is a lingering issue hard to heal in the middle of a season when everyone rushing u backcalf injury thats really all there is to it but for some reason people refuse to accept that slows you downyeah sga is very good but hes not playmaking for and elevating his team like luka does sga is just a very good player whos is on a very stacked well built and deep team credit to sam presti and the okc org but luka is a transcendent playerits all narratives anyway people who vote on it are also dumb asfngl expected more luka glazing in this thread but there is a surprising amount of posts about shai people really hate him out here hahahai do agree luka shouldve been higher that season i was surprised to learn he only got first place votes i think voting was fine it was a tight race despite getting pretty toxicimagine taking a thread about a great player and using it to complain about another playerwins mattertook the youngest team in the league to the seed with better advanced stats and defense funny how for certain players pra are everything but for others people recognize they dont tell the full storywatch his rookie highlightshe used to quite a bitmvps were consistent untill westbrook won he broke the matrix by winning as a th seedit used to be the

was unreal one of the most dominant offensive performances i have seen i honestly thought he was going to win mvp or be a close second it was kind of odd how he was a very distant third insteadhe also generated pts pts off his assists the most points by any player in a single seasonyou must be a young bulls fan to leave first peat jordan off a list of best offensive players evercherry picking to the max lmao and a list of players easily better offensively than lukalebronjordancurryjokichakeemwadeembiidgiannisshaimagickareemhardeni cant remember the full context but there was a thread where a dude told me that dwyane wade was a quote way better finisher than luka which is just objectively untrue even accounting for era and volume he also claimed that wade was way more athletic and way more vertical than anthony edwardsso its really not when you consider context sample size lukas slow playstyle leads to less chaotic layupsid say shai shooting a higher pt than prime shaq is much crazier and less cherrypickedits been a tough year loli can defense is fkn weak every day and theres stars going against weak teams every night how often does someone light up more than ptsalmost every star players career high has come against a mediocre or bad defense luka should be praised for his point game instead of having it nitpicked by analystsyoure mixing up the game against new york the was strictly minutesthats another absolutely insane game from him that i feel is underappreciated nowthey praised embiids points like days earlieraveraged on great efficiency during the regular season had a point game on shooting made the finals after only being an elite team after the trade deadline and lost to a historic team with a top net rating of all timetraded without his knowledge halfway through the next seasonbro that trade fucked me up so bad i moved to chicagoalso shaq or lebron in hsim on season its a pretty cool showhe got smoked few times by jalen brown in the finals while playing on a calf strain bloody knee and bruised ribs and showing up to games bandaged literally like the mummy and people threw him to the sharks unrealthey had seasons of being truly bad since the s and talk about it like they had it harder than any franchise has ever had itits weird mani became a lakers fan by default because i came into the sport through the luka trade i was bored and depressed i needed something to do first thing i noticed is that man this fanbase is weak as hell it obsessively lionizes its retired players and turns savagely on its current ones it has the weirdest possible fixation on kobe in particular its not even a he was one of our greats thing its this strange memory culture where doing anything but praising kobe is verboten including being happy about current playerslike most fanbases would be overjoyed to have lebron even past his peak lebron but theres this weird sneering contempt among some laker fans for him just absurd i remain a fan because i like the team but the fanbase is just fucking strange to me manhes a victim of false narratives in the media by liars and xenophobes like stephen a when the biggest name on espn constantly downplays you it has an effectyeah but triple double duhto be fair its not like nuggets were healthy either murray literally missed more games than kyriethunder fans really do suck assfor nowi legit hate okc fansa old injury prone big man who wants to cosplay as a and a throwaway role player is nothing for a mvp candidategiannis has no argument over jokic for last seasonembiid shouldve won in first center to average since moses first center to win the scoring title since shaq was by definition the most valuable player leading the sixers to their most wins since oh yeah and dropped on jokic in january that year lmaoedit and he played defense pretty goodshai had better numbers and an historical record stop this bullshit embiid too obviously but im tired of that fightthe last three mvps have all gone to the right people imoembiid was just elite this one couldve been giannis too but the scoring title went to embiidjokic was by far the best in advanced stats and tied for firstshai was the best in advanced stats and won gamesshai was the clear mvp last year imo no idea how people are saying someone else shouldve wondallas had most starters missing games and only finished games below denver the counting stats werent close he averaged a whole more points per gamejokics efficiency wasnt even as dominant that year he was at ts yeah but he was at compared to lukas i dont mind thinking jokic should have won but i do mind this insane idea that it wasnt closebut i thought pra was enough for mvpsi dont think so luka had a better season played with ass team before trade deadline and then adapted to whole new team after that luka was far away the best player that yearill even hear that out despite personally thinking luka was better the fact that luka came rd that year is a crime against humanitywhy does it matter if neither of them won it were fighting over s nownot even nike thinks that they send him selling converse lolmost teams would love to have the absurdity of a depth okc had that team was stacked with scorers and defenders on every position lolremind me when luka can play defense or not get targeted at leasti mean he literally outplayed luka when they matched up last year like by a wide margin too lolits like you willingly admit to not watching the gameswe saw shai get gassed and picked on defense in the finals the last nba games that were playedthe same thing happens to doncic because both players have an insane offensive load ffs even pg said that luka was a good defender when he had the energy to defendits fucking hard to play both sides as the guy these days its a fact that both offense and defense are harder to play than ever physically and stamina wise and all of the injuries we are getting just prove the pointshai isnt much better than lukaadvanced stats also said manu ginobili was the best player in the nba from i would love to see luka and sga switch teams you think sga would have won his accolades last season if he were on the lakers luka would also win mvp fmvp and a ring with okcshai has had better accolades and advanced stats in one out of seven seasonschecks flairyup makes senseso they gave him mvp before the season started this award is a mess why does it hold so much importance to people thenby far is insane i mean is disgusting and he didnt get a real contending roster until the trade deadlinesaying that not only in the face of the statistical fact but after seeing luka own the whole thunder team in the playoffs that year is somethingand wanting to rep slovenia which is very admirable about him but it affects his summer recoveryonly won more games while having one of the healthiest teams in the league while the mavs had one of the most injured but ok manluka had better bpm vorp and lebron than sga that season the only thing sga had ahead was epm if youre gonna act like epm is the only advanced stat everyone should care about then sure but say that beforehandno its not the pra its the okc had virtually injuries all season while all of the people around luka missed a ton of time including kyrieonce luka had a squad healthy post trade deadline they were dominating if dallas didnt have injuries they would finished right there at the top considering they only lost less gamesluka was a dominant dominant playmaker all season you guys just thinking picking the advanced stat guy makes you smarter watching basketball you know through months while the team is injured and you got seth curry aj lawson and omax prosper out there is mvp shitbro is still pissed about being traded lol he probably already has the dallas games marked on his calendarremindme monthsbro knows its ring time now that boston is deadexactly my thought but mjs best individual season came before they started winningactually if we disregard wilts insane numbers is by far the best ever individual season games played gp minutes per game mpg points per game ppg scoring champion field goal fg free throw ft rebounds per game assists per game steals per game league leader blocks per gameand dpoyi mean averaging on shooting from the field and winning dpoy who does this shitmagic averaged like ppg lebron and wade no not from a pure offensive standpoint lukas betterthe others are debatableu think ant is more athletic than wade ill give you the finishing at the rim but do u even watch games or do u just watch basketball referencewasnt there a stretch that season where many point pieces dropped in a matter of days within each other not to take anything away from your argument i agree with you it just made me think of that crazy stretchboth of those games are in top of all time game score stats lol and i was also conflating it with donovan mitchells point game that happened around then where he also hit a missed free throw put backif luka did it first they would have dissed embiids just as much imo it was just huge scoring games so close together that sparked the no defense discourse upnico is a horendous gmafter a calf injury too lmao so even if he is slowed down a little in that half a year i mean duhdidnt win mvp as welloh thank god has sense finally returned and people are realizing that yes luka is good actuallyfinished third in mvp too btw not sure what more he couldve done honestlyand robbed of an mvpthey didnt lose to boston they got destroyed dallas was a really good team they shat the bed in the finalspg had a great clip talking about how in their series when he was on the clips luka was actually defending really well but its nearly impossible to carry an offense and have the energy to defend well for a whole game as a guard these days the injury obviously made it way worse along with all of his teammates shitting the bed offensivelyheres the clip being afraid of a post magic world then shaq decides hey i want to be in hollywood then years later the exact thing happens with lebron shit is comical how rigged things seem to bewhy choose the lakers out of all teams thoughit really is youre not alone there you dont see this sort of behavior anywhere else and ive watched both the mlb and nfl i think it has to do with the decision of having so many former top players be such a prominent part of broadcasting i dont think ive seen anything close to anything comparable on a seed flirting on a seed harassmentkyrie was not only one injured so was lively and other key playersyeah its kinda weird how insufferable theyve become youd think theyd be happy right now but they seem more miserable than everyeah i mean i can understand lakers fans being insufferable cause they are but when nuggets fans and now thunder fans act like theyre a dynasty after one championship is cringe inducing beyond beliefluka isnt on your team anymoreeverim not surprised youre spewing zionist slop on the rsoccer subreddit lmfaook guybecause he is insanely hated on this sub lolthe funny thing is that lukas absurd stats are in large part due to playing timejokic per poss luka per poss shai per poss we saw shai gassed and targeted in the finals too but you guys aint ready to admit that its nearly impossible these days to be one of the best of all time offensively while not sacrificing defenseeh sga gets targeted too any guard would look a lot better defensively on a team where theres like elite perimeter defendersyoull have to refresh my memory on sga getting picked on defensively last i saw he had the most steals and blocks for a guard in a finals series ever they put him in a ton of actions sure but the pacers players flat out admitted that that was their game plan to tire him out so he would collapse offensively in the th like he did in or so games thats a far cry from the embarrassment that was luka against the celtics which even ignoring the blowbys you could pretend was from his injury was just him lacking effort and awareness and prioritizing whining to the refs instead of focusing on the gamei seriously think people are memoryholing just how bad he was last year say what you will about sgas on ball defense being poor at times but he never just gives up on plays the way luka does have to take them with context was manu the first option noremindme monthsluka wouldve won mvps by nowand that happens to be last seasonthe last season he has including the season that is considered your guys best so hes had seasons better and way better accolades its not closea devin booker lover doesnt know what its like to have a top player on their team were not worried about you it was going to be embiid before he got hurt but it really did feel like everyone just decided to give it to jokic the second embiid got hurtyoure acting like he didnt also have an mvp caliber seasonyeah luka owning the thunder sure got him lots of awards and a championshipand the mavs didnt have their proper roster until games left with the trade and their nd best player missed gamesit showed instantly in the playoffs who really was the best team in the west wins is huge dudeis there an english translation for this commentluka was ahead of sga in epm that season rd to thbpm and vorp are the same thing and they are shit lmao and no thats false he outperformed him in epm darko net rating rapm raptor you know just the modern ones that are actually respected as well as per and win shares for good measure for you dinosaurs living in the stone age so no he cleaned him in every way stans favorite pasttime is changing reality to fit their agendathe narrative he was far above everyone and he got robbed is pra narrative no one said he didnt have an elite season but he was not in his own tier like so many stans like to make out and the final ranking was a reasonable one advanced stats are there to pick up on the tangible and intangible things that lead to wins and clearly some people are slow to understand that the guy who has made his team outperform the ous every season might just be that influential whether its all on the court or by leadership or his affect on culture whatever it is its clearly there and the people looking past pra can see thati mean if you really think about it lukas year was the only one where boston were healthyman i wish luka beat the cs when they were beasting tho years down the line people will say that tatum beat luka in the finals and so he is high in all time rankingsmjthe steals and blks were fake and if you adjust the numbers they are impressive but he got better seasons his season was better the triangle offense was already master by the bulls roster and he had lost a step on the defensive end in comparison but he still was elite ia pts rts ast reb stock bulls offense was points better than league averagegenuinely one of the dumbest things ive ever read wow luka has become the most overrated player ive seen in any sportu think ant is more athletic than wadehow is that what you took from the commentthe guy claimed that wade was way more athletic than ant i said thats wrong how do you think that means im claiming the exact opposite to be truewade and ant are pretty clearly the same tier of athlete with probably a slight edge to wade neither one is noticeably more athletic than the otherthis sub hates wade so anything against will get upvotesidk man i did not get to see prime wade but its hard to imagine someone being way more athletic than ant excluding lebronyeah embiid scored kat scored it was a great week for hatersfor as little as he is given his flowers at least it was kinda nice for a few days until the haters came back the game thread was crazy celtics and raptors fans were like feed joel put him back in loli get criticizing his defence but the actual hate calling him bad is pretty wild ngl though i do kinda enjoy the luka weight watcher memes though hahahai know i enjoyed feeling like i got hit by a brick seeing people say this generational player was bad cause he lets people by him on defensedallas was a good team celtics were all time stacked and fully healthy unlike mavsman listening to that other dude made my braincells commit suicidelol cant believe someone is actually going out there and saying theyd take jrue over luka lolits not rigged its wanting to play for a historic franchise in a beautiful locationmost celebrities youtubers whatever choose to live in la ofc young millionaire athletes wanna be there toocome on now its fun to hate but theyre obviously a historic franchise with great colours and past and present playerswhy choose the second most decorated team in nba history with the a top player of all time and a top player of the decadei liked luka and lebron and since i got in due to everyone and their mother talking about the trade it was a natural fitif im rooting for an eastern conference team its the pacers thoplease dont rope those losers in with the rest of us thats not a real fanthey know they dont win game if halliburton doesnt get hurtstill owns your entire citynah for now hold onto that chip give it a good polish your owners will come reclaim it soon till then be a good boy and sip water from your bowlnot surprised because i hate okc fans makes senselol i cant people really trying to discredit a superstar playing minutes per game for two months to keep his team in the playoff playing more minutes should be praised tfi would love a clip since apparently im not ready or some shit lol you luka stans are something elseclips bozo id love to see what youre talking aboutthe context is that shai has an historical team around himlmaoi dont think anyone would disagree that sga was better than luka last season but luka has been much better over the course of their careers and should be expected to be better going forwardcould have been three guys going back to back all in a row would have been cool and might have poured some cold water on all the mvp discourse nah nevermind we know how it goeshe did but so did giannis and sga for instance dont wanna discredit because hes playing at an mvp level every year but there is no reason luka shouldnt have won it based on how the awards been decided recently the guy had a point game fgsso is having your whole lineup healthy all year vs your starting center and number option missing gameshuge he says lmaothese are all common advanced stats lol you should ask the reply underneath for english translationno he wasnt he was below him with to u should def watch some wade highlights im not saying way more atheletic but definitely more athletic and he used it betterbro the nico thing might be rigged nglremovedhow bout them cowboysluka is just slovanian harden broholy shit this is cringe youre not that guy brobut should others be punished for being good enough to not play so many minutesnoone is posting clips and i cba watching the whole vid but this should be about the same thingit was a huge talking point in the finals how sga was getting gassed and jdub was too inconsistant to take over the loadthese days its impossible for a guard to carry the whole offense and still have the energy to be great at defense for a full game you gotta sacrifice one or the otherthunder fans are goofballs enjoy your and only chip you will win fta is not better than luka jokic and giannis were blowing by hima historical team where the consensus is that the offense is hot garbage without shaiyall need to make up your mind about this okc teamnope shai was way better last season than lukas ever beeni am literally looking at the epm website right now where are you getting those numbers summer vacationyou have commented times in the past hours k karma in days youre new to basketballliterally the dude whos acting like he started watching basketball last yeardont you wanna find a better way to spend your summer vacation before school starts are you really happy with yourself for sitting on reddit spewing shit takes for most of you day cmon bro youre better than thatbeing good enough to not play so many minutesyou mean their team being more healthy and bettercrazy how he isnt better yet every advanced and counting stat used to determine jokic as the best from now counts sga as the best but he isnt pray tell how mr redditor has come to that conclusionsorry lil bro i dont watch tiktok we must not have been watching the same game since he had either steals or blocks in every game of the finals in fact he has the most stocks by a guard in finals historyyou literally won the series against memphis with shai playing like ass loljust stop he wont ever know who you areluka won titles while fighting akne fta didnt even had the trust of his own franchise when he was so they tankedyoure looking at offensive epm only how more of a cliche stan can you be to forget that defense exists and is half the gameholy fuck sounds about oklahoman to me thothank you for spending your free time countingor hear me out shais team has finished above lukas yrs in a row even tho shai had to play with rookie jdub no chet and no good role players yrs ago maybe shai just leads to more winningsga is a perfect defender if you refuse to watch any proof to the contrary yeahbro i dont care im an okc fan before a shai fanbut all summer there have been takes on here about how okc isnt that good because noone but shai and sometimes dub can get a bucketbut when the reverse needs to be true to argue against shai all of a sudden the supporting cast is all time great gtfohno i an not looking at offensive epm i am looking at total epm see hereagain where are you getting your numbersremovedare you arguing that the thunder have a worse team than the lakers and nuggets if you remove luka from the lakers even last year and jokic from the nuggets you get sub teams you remove shai from thunder and you still get a playoff teamor hear me out in shais teammates were healthy all year and okc had the least games missed from the starting lineup dallas missed kyrie lively and multiple role players for large chunks of timemaybe in luka led to more winning shais team finished above lukas cool but what happened in the playoffs when luka had a healthy team there was no debate about who was the better player until this season where luka was hurt and shai continued to make gradual improvementsyou in bird must be better than this mj guy look how much further the celtics are going every year than the bullswell im sorry i dont watch your brain rot zoomer shit bud id happily watch a video from one of the many websites that dont require an account such as youtube or vimeo or do you only know how to watch deep fried edits with subway surfers stitched over halfedit instead of random cherrypicked clips that every superstar defender has here are his defensive stats from the finals problem wasnt okc is ass on offense without shai you literally have shooters all around him and guys who sometimes can get a bucket on their own the problem was that he didnt have a great second option j dub was inconsistent af no one was talking about okcs supporting cast being ass lol you are fighting a strawman and i would argue okc was still a year away from being an actual championship just got lucky with injuriesthe website stop looking at expected and look at actual you know the production that occurred in reality another classic stans trick is the live in hypotheticals instead of what happened on the court huh guess i can count to at least smh i clearly was talking about years agowere birds teams worse than mjs at any point in those yearsi dont have a tiktok account and could watch the video finelmao steals and blocks what is this james harden led the league in steals once so have steph and aialright bro you got it enjoy your day i believe actual epm is new for the season do you have a link or screenshot of actual epm for the seasonoh youre so smartdude you listed shais per stats of course i think youre talking about the year season luka was when he played while sga was when he played so in fact yes even with rookie jdub and no chet thunder still had the better supporting castwow i guess i should listen to that critical analysis by the user known as slimdookie his clip also had five possessions that were spaced out over seven basketball games so if hes getting blown by or hunted you would think he would be targeted more than half a percent of all possessions considering he played almost minutes a game i can also find five possessions of jrye holiday getting blown by does that make him a bad defender not truedid you respond to the wrong comment thenits not about the outcomes of the possessions its about how fundamentally unsound sgas footwork is half the time how waning his effort is and how much he relies on gambling for steals he can afford to because he has the best rotating defense in years behind him to close the gap when he fails to get the steal nobody considered him anything better than a middling defender two years ago when the thunder had yet to assemble a defensive juggernaut around him i dont believe hes gotten anything more than slightly better since hes just looked better in a much reduced defensive role with teammates to cover up his mistakeswhat is the url of that website it doesnt look like the official epm websiteno wayyeah im just going to have to respectfully disagree im not sure how you gamble for multiple blocks a game but he averaged more blocks a game than jokic in the regular season and had multiple games in the finals with three blocks in addition he is absolutely not hunted on defense otherwise their defensive rating would have gone up when he was on the court and it never did especially when okcs bench has several very bad defenders in their guard rotation such as isaiah joeoh buddy stop digging your hole youre wrong get over itwhy dont you just give me the name of the website you are looking at',\n",
       " 'yeah dawg mil in this nba economy a little rich for these teams bloodjust gake the qo ball out and hit ufacould detroit pay him or not worth itfeel like he couldve been good on magic before they threw everything at desmond banethat brother gone him and cade gonna be an interesting duowhy does letterboxd follow this man lolgonna look good in blue and goldlast post got deleted but ill say the same here i might be going against the grain here but i think cam has a better case for his contract demands than kumingathe guy has scored forty points ten times in his career despite only being firmly in the rotation for seasons his scoring is a natural talent and brooklyn is not in a position where they should be cheap regarding moneybut for some reason the worst team in the league has cold feet giving an elite young scorer for some reason sean marks flopped with the draft and hes flopping here toodo the bulls have money to give him figure he can be their option after they move on from coby whitenuggets offer him a fuck it add some instant scoring to the bench unitsend him to the lakersi like cam thomas he takes crazy shots but he can flatout score ive seen worse players get similar contractshe played with cole anthony at oak hill might as well run it back can be docs jamal crawford the carmelo anthony strat lolnets set up such a bait contract go take the qo for mil something or get mil from us but its a team option next year if you show outfrom cams perspective i dont think he sees much difference between him and tyrese maxey and jalen green so his ask makes sense even if the reality is he probably is not getting million a yeardidnt realize he only played games last season injury or did they deliberately shut him downdude is so overrated in his mind hes a fringe role player with sixth or seventh man potential his ceiling is dennis schroder take your money and prove you deserve more with your playlol this offseason has made it so clear how little you guys have actually watched cam and just rely on podcasters for your takeshes getting into eating vaseline on camera territoryoh no anywaynow people in this thread interested in cam thomas lol i thought being double teamed meant youre a horrible player that doesnt know what to do with the ball all bad players get double teamed thats what was said rightanyway he was likely tired of the trolling and restating his ig especially for the old picture trolls and his agent likely advised him to clean all of that up stop reading too deep and just wait for more informationi thought he got traded to the nuggetsbro is going on his own ben simmons arcoh no how else will people see his playmaking ability if he deleted all of his highlights from brooklynseriously players like thomas are going to have a rough few years as the market corrects if you aint max youre mle no in betweenthe thing too is he believes that hes this star talent when there isnt much pointing to that yeah you can score like anyone but what else do you dohell likely be in this situation next offseason tooif you take the qualifying offer teams cant easily trade for you because you get the ntc and they lose your bird rights have to depend on the teams to have open cap space which may also be tough depending on who ithe cant ball out if they play the guards they just drafted ahead of himdeletedi just dont think he will have the same green light and as many minutes next season the nets brought in like guards this draft and a wing they are going be getting minutes over cambet on yourselfhes worth malik monk jordan clarkson money but the new cba might have ruined their salaries tooabout to sign ivey and duren to extensions and the other deals this summer basically prioritize staying flexible next few yearsthey have a m trade exception but probably more likely to use it to add sizedetroit has cade and ivey as their future backcourt what would they do with cam thomaswhy would detroit want himwould rather have bane any dayyeah i like cam and he was one that i was keeping an eye on for us wouldve been cheaper too and nice to have that extra for a upgrade next off seasonvery happy and very much looking fwd to watching bane in our lineup but yeah cam would have done just fine alongside suggs paolo and franzdetroit signing him would be really stupid i think theyve been much better lately so i dont think they do itthe nexts and letterboxd did a promo thing a couple months back blue and goldteams are much more likely to take a swing on a longer athletic guy than a short defensive liability cam is a good player but i think teams arent sold on him being a winning playertbh i think the fact that he only played games last is hurting him more than anyone wants to admit teams are already wary of handing out big contracts with the new cba if hes injury prone then theyll get even more gunshymarkss failure to flip any of five firsts for a decent assetmove up plus the reluctance to give cam a new contract is finally making me question him i just dont see what the vision is apart from being bad and getting pickssorry for the deleted post it got autoremoved once i edited and added a link for imagesi put it on comment section insteadthe ents are nowhere near contending and thomas has little trade value not worth getting locked into him in a way that may hurt your flexibility laterkuminga is assbecause he isnt part of the game plan long term so giving him a contract even though they have the cap space would basically make it impossible to trade him to somewhere that will actually need him kuminga is different because the warriors need to do the same thing but they are also demanding an arm and a leg cam thomas and kuminga true market value is whatever teams would need them in years with some cap space ex knicks for whatever reason need another scorer to push them over the top they target cam thomas or kuminga whatever the knicks can clear in space is what the nets would need to ideally sign thomas to contract wise so now the nets are essentially looking at every possible team that may want thomas in years and checking their possible cap spaces that is the contract thomas is getting offeredevery indication is that the nets like cam thomas sean marks himself spoke about the importance of resigning the guys who have developed with the team people in this thread are bringing up detroit but the nets will instantly match whatever the pistons offer if they go that route they are playing the restricted free agency game its cam his agents job to present the nets a reason to pay him or accept the qualifying offer weve seen cams archetype of player become devalued and moved for pennies this offseason i dont think its fair but it is what it is also its far too early to say if anyone flopped with the draftplease god noidk why ppl assume the bulls will move on from coby i highly doubt they dothey will likely keep giddey and white and then let ayo go or trade ayoim not sure if the bulls would do that coby and cam are similar players and keeping coby would be a great show of loyalty it might be an intangible but enough intangibles should surely stack right i think coby and cam are very very close in what they bring and can do so to me this would seem like a lateral move itd be strange to go grab cam when theyve already got cam at home but just as goodin fa we have few assets to trade for him but we could use him off the bench for surehamstring issuesdennis is a bizarre examplei feel like this is going beyond the point of just blatantly underselling cam thomas now i know hes this subs new favorite dude to drag through the mud but this comment having upvotes is insaneits honestly more fun to speculate bc of the implications if cam takes the qo that potentially shakes up the entire rfa market bc the nets would suddenly have more money to make a move on someone elsecam johnson got traded to the nuggets thomas is the small guard dropping on occasiontheres going to a lot teams with cap space next yeardefinitely notah didnt realise you get a ntc makes more sense why kuminga has no leverage eithernone of those guards looked good in sleven if there isnt a ton of cap space he can at least pick where he wants to gojordan clarkson the recent min offer signee for the knicksuhm reportedly the pistons dont want to pay ivey ivey and camt actually sit in kinda the same boatth mantrade ivey for thomas lolof course but cam thomas would have cost them just salary not frps or maybe frp to get off kcpbane is a better player obviously but id personally rather have cam thomas and frps maybe im too high on cam thomas though he dropped on us last seasoncade is like lukacam is like kyrie thing can work albeit it would be temu versioni cannot think of a team that needs cam thomas less than the lakers what do they need with a ball dominant ball hog instant offense guy when they have luka lebron and reeveskuminga isnt a winning player either theyre both cut from the same cloth kuminga just has better athletic gifts while thomass offensive game is more polishedyou score to win the gamehaving a caruso type guy is a luxury but having a cam thomas type guy is a outright needbeing bad and getting picks is a great strategy though okc did it drafted players per year for three years and are now the youngest championsits likely that there were no deals outside of trading for those picks except for maybe distant st from desperate competitors would you have preferred a couple late distant frps instead of drake and beni think sean marks actually likes cam i just dont know if jordi does though nets gameplan at this point seems like passing the ball around for seconds and giving a grenade to mpj all seasoneither way looks like marks is waiting to see if theres a salary dump of some sort he can do with the remaining cap space thats why they still havent even officially signed sharpe or ziaire but leaving cam out to dry like this shows they dont value him like hes in their longterm plansnets are probably the least talented team in the league with cam but generationally talentless without him playing hardball with a year old per game scorer is just ridiculous to me nets dont have the luxury to be pedantic with someone like cam in my opinion well be insanely lucky to have just one of our rookies be even close to the player cam already is and hes only going to get betterhes godawfulit could be backfiring on us if were playing this gameid love to trade for ayohed be an awesome defender off the bench for us and is an upgrade over gabeid trade salary filler and a pick swap for him as well as a second if neededyea it would be an offer sheet we dont have much cap so im sure brooklyn would just match unless he absolutely told them he wants to leave but it wouldnt hurt imooh come on are you really trying to sell this dude as an allstar delusionalthey arent going to give a bag to any of the other rfa or else they wouldve already and cam becomes a no trade qo player that no team would trade for not because they wouldnt want him but because they wouldnt bet against themselves losing assets for a free agent coming upohhh yeah that dude tyand theyre still gonna be hesitant to give big money to volume scorers who offer little else teams dont want to immediately get back into cap helldoesnt mean those teams want to pay cam thomas myrso it will be even funnier when no one gives him the type of contract he wantsthat doesnt matter anymore teams are avoiding the second apron no matter whatall the money goes to the top bron joker ect sucks but the days of role players like otto porter making million are overwill they though extensions trades their own free agents to signhes only worth the mil a year the nets are offering him maybe a hair more with the new cba teams dont overpay for non stars he could end up losing a lot of money if he pushes the can to next year humble yourself realize you are not who you think you are and accept the deal from the netswhich means jack shitsummer league is meaningless bro its just there for rookies getting some playin time and fans can watch them load managesothats not true traore looked really good he got injured thowith the the nets offered it seems they might help him go to whatever team he wants for some other assets but there hasnt been any news or rumors of other teams interested has thereand still being paid around million from the jazz making million total next season jazz just bought him out so he wont take shots from walt brice zay key and ace since clarkson is a shot chucker just like cam thomasprobably meant clarkson from years ago not year old clarkson right now especially after hes had two down yearsohh where did we see the ivey news if you can get cam for just over the mle and ivey is asking for way more thats not the role cam thomas wants though and is he really what detroit needs after losing two key pieces in beasley and thjbut bane is better at everything tbh i think bane is worth it for themim a knicks fan that stayed around watching nets after kdkyrie people will parrot the empty calories thing forever now just like currys defense back then they probably also havent watched a single nets game past years the guys showing a lot of talent sat his rookie year cause of win now mode with nash next coach was dnping his best prospect randomly jordy developing him and he gets hurt all while nets fans turn against him feel for himtemu version is quite the understatementyeah he makes no sense for us unless hes cheapwe need to improve our bench offense but benching rui for smart should be sufficientyeah but a team looking to get some value out of either probably see more potential in making kuminga a winning player than thomasthe thing is cam thomas isnt going to push the nets back past the first round and also would hold zero trade value if you gave him a large contract all hed do is randomly get hot enough to potentially give you a bad draft pick but never enough to be a serious contenderwhat makes cam thomas a needi think scorers are needed in every team but theres not a lot of teams with ft tall scorers that are successful compare that to thr athletic wings which every team wantsobviously kuminga has his own flaws but if you were choosing one i think most teams prefer the length and athleticismno it isnt lol what year do you think this is they also got a young top tier talent as part of the trade going into the tank brooklyn dont have that theyre relying on the crapshoot that is the draft to find onewizards and houston did the same thing im a big believer in getting multiple guys in every year and roll the dice instead of getting one guy in every year and hoping he can be a difference makerwe got dawkins from okc front office and so far we have from the last three years bilal tristan cam whitmore trade aj johnson trade tre johnson kyshawn george bub carrington alex sarr will riley jamir watkins malaki branham trade dillon jones tradethats ten first rounders and one second rounder from the last three draftsdid any of their drafts leave everyone scratching their heads the way brooklyns just didthey can offer me a contract with the money savedstill hed be unrestricted even if offers arent as much as he wants he can still take the best one and nets cant matchthank youl i dont think people realize that this is the reality of his archetype its not just the big bad nets being mean to cam thomas hes just not valuable look at how hard it is for the kings to move off of malik monk and how the jazz had to send draft assets to move off sexton that archetype isnt what the nba is looking foreven in the nba growing income inequality pushed by oligarchs working hand in hand with a small number of upper union management so they get more and more of the money is a thingyeah i bet that half of the teams that are projected to have cap space wont by the time june hitsexactly theyre still trying to tankno team has cap space this summer there is no guarantee they will trade him to a team he likes unless they happen to have assets the nets wantclarkson is woahi would have cam thomas over iveynot the role he wants but no team is going to give him anything elsei agree if theyre in win now mode which they should be with paolorui is a way better scorer than smart lollol smart is washed and rui is legitimately good and one of their only catch and shoot guys why would they ever do thatdude would be toxic on the bench in his th year when hes trying to put up empty calories for the big contractzero chance smart starts ill be surprised if he plays meaningful minutes after the all star breakon a good team hed be a decent th man but those guy dont get paid mil a yeartheir entire team is on a rookie contract besides players the nets dont have to worry about the playoffs anytime soon theyll be a lock for a top pick the next two years honestly i dont really see a problem paying cam what he wants its a slight over pay but by the time theyre tryna win that contract is probably expiring or close to expiringtheir options are to rely on the draft or gain enough assets to trade for a star and have enough cap space andor assets to build a competent team around themthere is no set formula to winning a chip as a raptors fan you guys didnt follow the route okc did to win your last championship its all a crap shoot just have to do enough to fill seats while creating the illusion youre trying to be competitiveokc also traded away their offensive only guard that no one can really figure out what they are worth in the league instead of giving him a bad contractthe salary cap hasnt been lowered though plus theres still a floor im pro players getting paid but i dont blame the owners here luka bron curry are the guys filling up seats and selling jerseys they are the guys that people come to see play you cant really put a price on how much a true franchise player like prime bronjoker is worth to his team it made zero sense that at one point bron was maxed out and getting paid the same money as otto porter if i was an owner id be pissed if i was forced to use a max slot on a role player like that the money is now concentrated at the top and thats who it should be going to million and up for the franchise guys cam thomas is asking for million in what world is he worth that much of a teams salary cap before this second apron existed he would have got it now hell get paid what hes actually worth the same money is being spent its just being focused elsewhereitll be interesting to see if bane is enough shooting they have literally no shootingthats what i meanrui being on the bench since smart will take his starting our spot will greatly improve our bench offensehalf of rlakers have a hate boxer for ruithe nets dont have to worry about the playoffs anytime soon theyll be a lock for a top pick the next two years so why would they want him then hell just take the ball away from the rookiespersonally i have a strong preference towards trying to be competitive as much as possible and trying to steadily improve the team over tanking and hoping the lottery balls land your way mostly because tanking is pretty miserable for fansthats my teams musicyep could be one of those years for the magic where they make a deep run or blow it up youd think they have a couple years but life moves so fast in the nba lolbut isnt rui gonna be in the starting lineup and smart on the benchits more about how they pay everyone with the hard capim not sure because there havent been any actual reports but i think benching rui for smart would make sensewe need better perimeter defense so having smart start over rui achieves that smart is also now best against s so swapping rui instead of reaves makes more sense for that reasonsmart hasnt had a good season or even close to a full season since he got traded from the celtics ur putting a lot of stock into a guy who more than likely is a bench player at this point in his career rui was also the lakers rd best player by a decent margin in the playoffs it makes more sense to bench reaves for smart if ur gonna believe smart can bounce back that much',\n",

       " 'reminds me a lot of the warriors simons playing the role of dlo too not a bad idea to take a yr off contention having whatever young guys get experience and ready for the optimism is their frpthis roster is built with purpose give jb white and pritchard rest but inflated stats when they play develop our extremely raw late picks and suck at interior defense so hard we end up with a good to great draft pickis anyone really optimistic about a year without tatumayo put some respek on sam hausers nameanything is possible in the eastas much as it stinks im completely at peace with the upcoming seasonif we scrap together wins its hearteningif we lose a bunch of games it gives us a chance at the apple and ample time to develop our young guys with real game experiencewtf was that thumbnailfuck it bro tank and bring aj homethey really should try to trade simons and future frps for a top young prospect that they can give time to develop this seasonim kinda excited to see who steps up at the for boston feel like amari williams could have a good rookie yeari see a lot of people assuming they make the playoffs but im with zach i could actually see them not even making the play in the thing is if they are toiling around the seed with a below record i could see them start to shut guys down going to be a rough year for the celtics but theyll probably be rewarded with the st pick next yearis it just me that thinks that the pacers will be better than expected the loss of hali turner sucks but the starting is still solid and youre hopeful that guys like furphy walker grasp at the opportunity that is being handed to them still got some quality contracts to go out and get a center in a tradewhy the fuck is satan therei mean zach theres quite literally no incentive for the celtics to win games next year if the depth chart looks weak and loaded with young unproven guys thats because its on purpose the best possible scenario for this season is to play the young guys tons of minutes and hope one or some of them pan out get a high draft pick in and then completely reshape the roster again summer of around the jays and white for a new contention windowthe over under is set at really seems like a win team tops thoughthe tiny wrinkle being the remote possibility tatum recovers sooner than expected allstar break would be months after injury and its not unheard of for players to recover quicker after the speedbridge if they tread water until allstar break tatum comes back and is miraculously close to the player he was in his prime and they make some kind of move they could make a runbut i really think they should be doing everything possible to tank a win season st round exit and mid st would be a disaster imo there is no greater route to improving than tanking for a top pick only two acceptable options contending or bottoming out otherwise its a wasted seasonthe real shame of it is that they dont have jack shit in terms of prospects worth developing say what you will about brads prowess but thus far he hasnt drafted a single guy who looks like they can even be a rotation player in part because his highest pick was like and in part because the only decent picks they had like one used for sengun was traded for veterans who helped them win the title during that small championship windowi dunno im pretty optimistic about winning games and seeing dybantsa in green for welcome to the new nba where you make great trades and draft well but cant afford to keep players on your team add in an injury to your guy and your team is cookedthis is their solution to parity for small market teams but its going to cost them ratings and hurt the sports popularity in the long runbe optimistic on me loving to see itidk the way i see it whitebrownpritchardsimons and a bunch of d players could go in the east if they get anything at all from hauserniangquetawhoever theyre a top in the conferencethe case is that the east is a jokewhos running the offense though mcconnell and nembhard they need a true point guard to play when mcconnell is on the benchsam hauser and george niang are both decent bench pieces thoughpeak reporting right there weve known this since the day after tatum tore his achillesnaw play to win brah dont be throwing in the towel just call your all nba roster is no more yall still have a competent roster but now its tanking seasonshows you who be really about it in these streetslol who was optimisticbest player is out all year and they traded away two starters and lost all their depth at cgive the young guys minutes to develop and maybe get a better draft pick team has been consistently contending obvious retool yearyep their championship window has slammed shutceltics are doing the gsw year reset i bet they go for a top pick bos mke wins under on boston over on milwaukee easy moneyi cannot state how much i hate it that fans are now wanting their team to lose teams should not be able to use their own first round pickim pretty sure thats the entire point of what theyre doing there genius tanking this season to try and get a lottery pick to pair with a healthy tatum brown and white next season plus with tatum back theyll be more willing to go into the second apron going for another titleyeah we knowbut a lot of players are getting injured sadlyso the teams that just traded their whole rosters for or stars are really in gonna be in deep shit if their stars go down and they spent their whole wallet on them and cant replace themthe new cba math is tough like thatso teams like celtics are focusing on drafting really well over the next years combined while other teams are in win now mode but dont understand the risk they are takingit will happen and i dont know what team it will happen to but it will happen our team is looking at this yearits crazy how quickly we got here after their championship win and basically retaining all members of their core everyone on social media and sports media said that theyd be running the east for the next years what happened to make it go downhill so quickly even with tatum missing a year you think you come back the year after thatceltics fans still are delusional and think theyll still compete this yearyeah if at least like hugo and walsh pan out this year that would be huge because now whenever your contention window opens up again you have two rotational wings for less than mill combined and the rest of the roster building becomes much easierarent they trying to trade simons lol so the depth chart is guysaj dybantsa exactly lol why is zach under the impression that we want to be winning games this yeargive us pritchard for a year well give him backi dont think the pick value is all the different between leaning on brown white and pritchard vs trying to build as good of a team as possible for tatum to potentially return to before the playoffs if we want to prioritize pick value we should trade white imoi might have more belief in your own team than you brown and white are better than any top two on any bottom half team them two pritchard hauser role players youre going to finish between if tatum comes back in time for the playoffs even if hes youre going to be as good as anybody in the east when it matters if you want a top draft pick youre going to need to tankrest utah jazz style on brown whiteyea they lost tatum porzingis jrue horford and kornet thats half their rotation and best players also simons is a negative player in my eyes so not much therethey shouldnt be this is a lukewarm take loleven the celtics arent optimistic judging by their offseason movesagreed but they definitely need at least some kind of interior defense or theyll be looking like the heat during the jimmy years tossing oversized undrafted shooting guards down theresame im excited for a season where we finally dont have any pressure to win every single gamethats certainly ideal but what team is offering a top prospect for a simons rental and a likely pluslike who top young prospects dont usually go for a package like simons plus picksthey are clearly hoping to move simons imo trading their guys for expirings makes it obviousfor sure if they could get a decent prospect for simons theyd do it but i suspect they are going to try to attach simons and niang together in a salary dump or something i think they have to wait until september th to aggregate them together but neither seems to factor into their longterm plansi guess theres a remote possibility they do something like combine simons niang and hauser mil along with sts and go after something major i saw someone throw out the hypothetical of sabonis but that only really makes sense if they think tatum is going to return this seasonpeople assuming they make the playoffs are also assuming the heat raptors bulls and sixers are gonna suck zachs opinion is that those teams will probably be better than the celtics pretty sure the celtics are still better than the hornets nets and wizards so theres not a lot of room to miss the playin even if theyre tryingi think both the pacers and the celtics will be better than people anticipate it definitely depends on what direction both of those teams want to go but i feel like they could both squeak their way into a playoff spoti agree i think there is path to the pacers being a low end playoff team but the question is does it really make sense to push for thathate the celtics but wins tops is pretty crazy even for this roster my guess would be wins tbhtatum isnt playing next year unless were good but not great without him if we suck theres no point in him rushing backhauser and niang are for sure rotational pieces on any team for their shooting alone the c position is the reason this team cant be trusted to be good tbhonly for this year next year will be a different story so long as jt is jtshould we want to drive jb and white into the ground to carry us to a nd round exit max and then be exhausted and get injured when tatum gets backtatum missing a year means its not worth staying in the apron that meant holiday and kp had to go and we couldnt afford to resign horford and kornet boom of your top players are gone including your entire front court rotation they went allin got a chip couldnt get a second and then cut their lossesno one thinks thistrying i think simons is on the team for the season opener maybe they move him by the deadline but i dont think other teams are willing to offer the cs what brad is looking for in a trade just yetit would appear no other team wants a dimensional player making mil per yearthe east is too bad for yall to miss the playoffspacers getting him sorryas a raptors fan heres an early f you if this happens respectfullyborn and raised just outside of boston we already know how this lottery will gohometown kid is a nice angle but boozer would be a better fit imohes not that was the case he was makingthe optimism he is refering too is in regards to only next season and the people that still have us as a playoff teamright bestcase scenarios are either guys take the opportunity to grow their games with an increased role we play hard and scrappy end up with a seed and maaaaybe make the second round were really bad and we get a sweet lottery pickhonestly i think one of the more important things to look at this year is mazulla i love him but hes only coached with a loaded roster how he handles a middling one could be the difference between him sticking around for years and sticking around for lmao honestly is an agreement like that allowed it would never happen but might be a genius move for both teamsif tatum comes back in time for the playoffs even if hes youre going to be as good as anybody in the east when it mattersno with white brown and a tatum youre not as good as anybody clearly worse than cavs and knicks and imho youd struggle against a big and physical team as well magic bucksthe big weakness is our center depth right now our best big is like luka garza neemias queta maybehopefully ants contract rightsizes after this season and his ego gets in check i think hed be a great th man scorer type player in the right situation m for points with the occasional point gameexactly this glad we can take year of just enjoying basketball as a neutral knowing that in a year we will be right back in ityeah im so happy were not going to be getting thinkpieces or fraud allegations after every single l anymore lmaoi mean you guys were rumored to although im skeptical of those reports the and rj seems like a wild package for simonsi think all of those teams are definitely better than the celtics the cs are pulling a san antoniotim duncan maneuveri think wed be a win team when everyone is healthy however brown can be penciled in to miss like games white probably like games and pp like games i dont see us keeping up that win pace in those games also the frontcourt is justlikeso badi mean who on the roster besides brown pritchard and white gives you any confidence next seasoni mean why is this team better than the kobeodombutleratkins teams that won the celtics are gonna be bad but they should try hard to be even worseright i think he should take the entire year off regardless but if were on pace for wins why would you rush himto me yes i think that would be better roster construction to not have your third player on a max deal i might have first hand experience cheering a team that made this mistake of maxing out an injury prone third playersometimes you have to trade away good players to have more depth to avoid exactly the thing you are worried about under these new apron rulesthe biggest celtics fan i know bill simmons thinks thissimons and combo guards that dont defend in general are hard to tradethats what i had thought initially going into the offseason but when looking at the actions of the front office every member of our frontcourt rotation is making the minimum besides niang who you could easily argue should be on a minimum contract thats the easiest way to do a subtle tank is by just not having any sort of interior defense thats why i think pina is right to think theres a decent possibility boston and indiana miss the playin altogetheridk i thought that before draft and free agency but this celtics roster is terrible lol the top guys are good but the big rotation is non existent and all the depth is young unproven guysbro after simons white and brown the rest of the roster is pretty dogshit they dont even a centerthey might decide to intentionally tank midseason like phillyyeah people dont seem to realize that if the celtics players try theyll almost certainly make the playoffs even with a barebones front court lola lot celtics fans seem to just assume we will fall into the lotteryboston won the title and indiana came within a game of winning it this year now you want to steal top prospects from the actually needy teams the greed sickens mei have seen the future youre getting mikel brown jryall can take boozeronly if you think boozer actually becomes an nba i personally think hes a and dybantsa is a dont seen why hes a better fit unless hes a the east is so weak that i still see us making the playin but i honestly hope we dont were not doing anything in the playoffs next year and wed miss out on a sweet lottery picknot allowed in the nba but is common in soccer leagueswe got close to this with jrue and portlandyou are probably right but theres going to be a lot of minutes to develop guys and the celtics have been pretty solid at that its a long season anything can happen im not ruling out a deep postseason run just yetagreed scorer off the bench ala lou will simons isnt a good playmaker and bad defender so he fits that clarkson role try to play him like cam thomas and your team has a problemi mean we definitely still will seeee jaylen brown cant be a number one but they will be easier to ignorethere were rumours around jrue to toronto if there was anything on simons i dont remember or can find itthat was for dwhite pretty sureusage rates of those guys will go up so statistically injury rategames missed will tick up tooi dont know if the celtics would commit to it but the smart thing really does seem to be to try and maximize that pick they already offloaded the money now get another cornerstone player to put next to tatum and brown for following yearssome fos just dont want to i was dying for heat to throw this season after the jimmy mess we were up to like the th pick at one point could have probably made top if we committedchicago won games last year with their complete mess of a rosteri wonder at the time of when he said that if he knew that horford and kornet werent coming back initially i thought like he did that we could still be semicompetitive and wed retain those guys but then the fo put forth the worstmost unproven center rotation in basketball after letting those guys go and like you cant win games like thatsure but counterpoint have you looked at the bottom half of the eastceltics will easily finish ahead of just by playing guys like brown and white then youve got messes like sixers raptors bulls heat celtics could easily end up with a seed just by virtue of sucking less than other teams at worst its staring at the play in without an intentional tankyou have white pritchard and brown you aint gonna get bottom record with that lolwhich is still better than teams in the easti dont think it was that intentional for philly lol joel was done pg was pretty much doneyea we would draft another guard wouldnt wei think hes a but maybe a good small ball for stretches pritchard white brown tatum boozer lineup could be fun but you bench pritchard when you need a real bigaj is just a taller version of jb imo probably peaks higher but boozer seems like supercharged horford which we know is a literal perfect fit with the jays lol i think peterson and boozer are both better and just better fits though i wouldnt cry if the cs somehow managed to get him at all lolwould it not be allowed if they trade him for a pick and then trade back a pick to get him later it would have to be separate trades which would make it not happen at alllmao yeah but i think atp we all know that jaylen brown cant be a on a championship teami think the best thing if i can even call it that that will come of this season is that fans are going to see how much worse we are without tatumi think even with horfordkornet you shouldnt expect them to competejaylen brown got knee surgery in the offseason i wouldnt be surprised if he misses a lot of time due to load management theyd have no incentive to put a ton of miles on him or white this seasonsixers will finish above the celtics gtfothe cs are literally an jb or white ankle sprain away from being a full disaster loltheir hand was forced but they definitely leaned into it since the season was lost anywaygotta be honest dont know too much about him just saw that his playmaking is one of his biggest strengths and thought oh perfect for indiana can help take the load off hali when hes back both dybantsa and brown are playing for usa in the fiba u tournament this is the reward we deserve for having our team usa representatives lose their achilles aj is just a taller version of jb imo thats exactly why they would take himi think youd get dinged for collusion if it was too obvious there also wouldnt be any way to enforce it so youd be gambling on how trustful the other team istechnically anything is possible with a backroom handshake deal it just wouldnt be enforceable would rely entirely on trust and a lot could happen which might make either team go back on such an arrangementits not unheard of though the celtics trading the number one pick to philly is an example they basically just had to trust that philly really did want fultz and that tatum would still be there with the third pickdefine compete if we had kept those guys then i would think we could be a top team with the weakness of the rest of the east both those guys are excellent defensive centers now without them we will be one of the worst defenses in the leagueyep so that merely puts them down in the pack with other teams shutting down jaylen is basically they way they can tank tank but short of that theyre going to win more games than many expect just due to awfulness of other teamsthat doesnt jibe with how they built this team not only is aj imo not as good as the other two he is a wonkier fit next two ball dominant wings peterson and boozer both have a much higher feel for the game better passers defenders and shooters and their games fit cleaner next to the two franchise iconsyeah if you give up a pick and then return the same pick its obvious but i could see the team trading away a player entering their final year and then doing a sign and trade or something but regardless there would never be a team dumb enough to do thisi mean i am jaylens biggest fan but you are maybe giving him too much credit the celtics are missing their entire frontcourt from last season and their starting point guardguard its not even just their entire starting front court but literally every member of the front court that got regular minutes and they replaced them with bottom tier defenders and this also includes their best player i am not anticipating a competitive season we will be lucky to sneak into a playin spotsure it does the celtics view the way wing as the most valuable archetype in basketball a couple of things you have to consider here is that jt is not going to return as good of a player as he was coming off an achilles injury and jaylen will be by the time the season starts aj would be the jb succession plan in all honesty and they would be able to ease him in and then youd think theyd move jb to try and get an elite big or guard some other people have mentioned this but its going to be extremely hard for us to build a contender again with of the cap going towards players it may not be feasible to get the other supporting pieces necessary thats why im so fucking glad jt and jb got done and they did it together theyre forever minted here because im unsure now if they will really get another realistic chance to compete for another ring together given cap finances those knicks games are going to haunt me for a long timeagain these are all just arguments about why the celtics will suck i dont disagree its just that a bunch of other teams are going to suck even morei mean again if you get the or pick you go with bpa and aj just isnt the bpa now if you get the and hes there you take him and figure out the rest later but peterson is a guard with a wingspan at any rate hes wing sized with point guard vision you always take those guys and boozer is who can handle shoot rebound and protect the rim you also always take those guys wings are great but positional outliers are even better',\n",

phil jackson was like thishe has his wellearned reputation as the chill zen master but on the rare occasions when hed get mad and explode it apparently scared the shit out of his players lolthats not true because few of those coaches are the best euro coaches of all timeyep wanted to say too this was all my coaches from junior level they score and you drop your pants and bend over is a classic also lolmost of the players in the nba would quitthere is also jasmin repea croatia in the video ive seen this from from macedonia to slovenia its endemic to former yugoslav countries these are just some of the most succesful and exposed coachesmazzulla would totally do something like thisjust in a deadpan wayyeah used it as a toolwhats not true yelling at players doesnt make them less successful not sure i see your point its just that its a mechanism of telling them they suck elevated emotion that can never be the normal but you cant use it all the time because it becomes ineffective and when players tune you out youre done as a coach of that teamps the quote provided to me was from mike keenan a pretty successful hockey coach won the cup with the rangers during his days in the khlalso players here are more used to it than in the us but you also had extreme cases in the states like bob knight in indianai think its more a playerspecific thing a good coach knows what both his team and his individual players will respond to and adjust accordinglysome players just completely tune out when the screaming starts others are galvanized by it etc you just have to figure out your players personalitiesthat too much yelling is bad and wont work after wasnt that the point of your commentthis is a valid point agreetoo much yelling wont work after a certain point yes not with the same group of players or often the same team but that doesnt mean that a coach who yells a lot wont be successful it only means that he likely wont coach one team for an extended period of time there are exceptions such as super successful coaches who stay because a players are willing to put up shit to win b organizations wont fire a super successful coach but it applies as a general rule so still dont understand what youre talking aboutyou cant just use an outlier like obradovic or any super successful coach and say if he can do it anyone can which is what youre saying and juniors are different especially in europe because no one gives a shit how you treat kids nothing nastier than yelling or in my day slaps as long as they learn the fundamentalsi mean it obviously can work as obradovic pesic ivkovic etc stayed for longer periods in clubs and the national team and won a lot often with the same players you cant say it doesnt work except if the coach is successful or if players put up with his shit you can use that argument with any coach because no styletactic will work if you are not successful and players dont like you no one is saying thats a good method and everyone should use it just that with certain coaches it works just like in nfl for example belichick and mcvay have completely different coaching styles but both are successful and probably wont be successful if they used the style of the other oneall the coaches you mentioned are outliers in the large pool of sports coaches the majority of which cant constantly yell at players because they dont have a gazillion insertbigasstrophy and that level of authority or player loyalty or management trustit can work for some usually the most successful ones it doesnt work for the large majority of themthe average coaching tenure in the nba is seasons slightly less as far as the euroleague goes so yelling or not very few stay for long stretches which again says nothing about trophies wonthey are not outliers because if you take the top balkan coaches of all time were like that even now take the top coaches in europe and at least have timeouts like this screaming and swearing who tf cares if all coaches in nd german league are nice and chill the only valid pool are coaches from top teams and nationsif you take the top balkan coaches and you proceed to tell me they are not outliers thats exactly what an outlier is its the top we take top euroleague coaches top balkan coaches but they are outliers and we dont count them but well count nd leagues amateurs and g league coaches as standards not outliers of good coachingdo you not understand the meaning of top or something top and bottom things in a pool of things are outliers the average isnt in laymans terms because i really cant keep explaining thissorry to disappoint you but this is an nba subreddit and these are euroleague and winning coaches so we are talking about the highest level of basketball bottom things are not relevant or your point is hey yelling works with best players and in high level but you know its not sustainable because if you try it in filipino league it wont work no one caresno we are talking about yelling as a motivating mechanism and how it impacts players and coaches in general at least i was and since you joined that discussion youve bounced around from top coaches to good coaches and a bunch of other topics i didnt mention such as this final comment so maybe not comment on a topic you dont wanna talk aboutlike i said this is nba subreddit and post about euro coaches not a subreddit or post about high school and pick up basketball level coaches so you are commenting on the wrong topicits a post about the behavior of balkan coaches in general not just the top onesfor example jasmin repea shown in the video is a class below top european or balkan coaches he was solid sometimes very good but not top tier but in any case im definitely done with this topic',\n",

westbrook more like westbrook laid the foundations for successrussell westbrooks remains became the fertilizer of these teamswell maybe except the lakersthey still hate himhe made it further in the playoffs than any of those teams except okc bounced the clippers after they got rid of him and gave them another first round exit loli laugh but the disrespect and decline of westbrook has been painful one of my absolute favorites ever at his peakwhat about utahget this bum on the kings prontominnesota if they can get it together lakers are a question mark chemistry and defense lebron ageso not sure regular season would just be to stay healthysince you been goooooooonewhy dont the pelicans get him and then cut him okc houston lakers utah clippers utah denver shanghaitop all time babywestbrook might js be the greatest the dynasty starts after you player weve seen in the nbaof course they thrived after getting rid of him hes a losing basketball playeryou dont even need to dig that hard to see how bad westbrook was for these teams even the nuggets fans who were cheering russ and saying the lakers scapegoated him in the middle of the season were begging adelman to stop giving him minutes in the okc series lmaoit was so close nuggets won the tiebreaker because they went during a westbrook injuryis this a reference about russ or just a basic jokeidk if ive missed a joke or notlakers are salty about westbrook the way celtics are salty about kyrieright i was gonna say something until i saw your comment post is bullshit take it down opit doesnt work if hes only on the team for a few hours he has to be there a whole year seep into the foundations shit in every toilet in the arena then when he leaves youll get the true westbrook bounceokc and houstons success were also after a total scrap they got rid of everything and everyone to redo it which is advice that doesnt apply to the other teams the clippers didnt improve and the lakers still have a flawed incomplete team both first round outs the nuggets came away from taking out the champs but have had a supporting cast so many people call shit seems like westbrook is the easy scapegoat for teams that think theyre better than they arefoundation you say he definitely was laying it bricks by brickssorry russ i couldnt help myselfmitwestbrook is that youi like to say that it was a necessary part of the timeline to get lukabut nah for real the russ trade was disastrous for us and yeah our fanbase still dislikes him there was briefly hype about him excelling in a bench role in the seasom but then that disappeared after he and the team regressed and he was later tradeda lot of people have fun laughing at him and then realize hes been to more wcfs than their teamminnesota maybe should join the club take a turn on westbrook he would fit right in with the shitty passing turnover dingles that lose their heads trying to drive in maybe two negatives can make one heaping pile of negatives and they can climb over each other to the top of the pile for once like a farm of antswhich dynasty was started after he lefttell me you dont know the meaning of the dynasty without telling mesuch a losing player that he only missed post seasons in his careerthats not true who else should have gotten those minutes either a hurt mpj who played really bad because of his shoulder or other bench players russ was easily our best bench player and im glad we had the option to play himyoure being down voted but i agreewestbrook looked ok for the nuggets on a minimum but damn i was wondering how great theyd be if they had any other decent sixth man who wasnt just a coin flip all the timebut if the nuggets went we would be the th seed the only way is if the clippers had a better head to head record with the nuggetswestbrook was the reason the nuggets made it out of the first round last seasononly playoff team they played in that stretch were the th seed magichilarious narrative framingif anything a true testament to jokicwas histhreepoint shooting percentagesince the allstar break at one point during the nba seasondidnt see the westbrook part was thinking next season picks he was good playerathletic ability could take over regular season games not winning basketball plays for playoffsokc is literally the only team that fits the bill for a dynasty that was entirely put together after he left and it took a couple seasons for that to even start soarguably the main ones that have a chance to become a dynasty would be okc houston both have young cores great depth were the top seeds last season they have a genuine chance to win multiple championships we would have to wait seehow many of those he won the title and how many he got bounced on the first roundyeah jokic wanted russ last season and he helped themhe also helped them have a strong stretch during the regular seasonbut he was also detrimental at times such as against okc in the second roundoverall id say it was good value for a vet mini think they would have beat okc without westbrook this upcoming season will be the ultimate testcrazy he shot like against the clippers for us i never knew his pt could drop that low loljeeze just pass the ball to the other team at that pointwell okc isnt a dynasty just yet they only won one championship this would be equivalent to calling the bucks a dynasty after the one chip they won and like you said its been years since he been theredidnt they get sga the same year they traded russthe dynasty starts and years later both those teams became lottery teams after trading westbrookhe was on the clippers and they were first round exits he left and they were still first round exits same with the lakers first round exitsi agree with everything you saidi think he was important to them and i think thats the issue your team cant rely on westbrook that much in this is a reach denvers rotation is even thinner wo russwe probably dont throw away g of the second round if russ isnt playing he played really well that nightnah i think okc were too talented in that seriesid still favour okc especially as their young guys continue to improve and theh benefit from championship experience but it should be better after denvers phenomenal offseason moves so farnuggets gonna have an almost entirely new bench lineup and new starter and youre gonna base any success they have on them not having westbrook lolas much as i like wesbrook his time with the lakers was at times pure basketball terrorismhe was doing plenty of that toowinning only one chip hasnt stopped this sub from declaring every winner a dynasty in the makingyes but not from trading russ they got chris paul from the russ trade who tbf was instrumental to sgas developmenti believe him and dort both joined in however most the rest of their core like holmgren jdub caruso hartenstein etc joined in the past couple yearsyeah cuz thats how rebuilding worksi think the issue was mpj aaron gordon and russ himself all being injured in the okc seriesand yet they went last year without westbrook including a critical win in the st round against the clippers the argument people always make with westbrook is that the team would be total trash without him dating back to his mvp days they can never make the case that the team is good with him so instead they have to resort to how bad the team would be without him and yet somehow a washed up cp took the thunder to a better record than mvp westbrook ever did and thats with presti trying to tank eg trading paul george and jerami grant for picksyeah but i wouldnt say it took a couple seasons to start when it really started with the acquisition of sga their best player by far obviously he had a ton of room to grow and the team was bad but it still really started when they traded russpgahhhhhh kg terry paul pierce must by the dynasty starts after you players toothats just bullshit westbrook was the only good bench player we had last season of course he has his bad games but he also has really good games and i dont think we has won against the clippers without himwe were with him in the starting lineupi know you really dont like westbrook but he was good for us and of nuggets fans and jokic would agree with thati guess youre the opposite of mitwestbrookdeletedidk how ray allen relates to any of this when he won a ring in boston miami was on that heatles squad kg paul pierce at least won a ring were a pseudo dynasty if you cant get out the st round as the guy idk what to say to thatthats the same argument thunder fans would make in favor of westbrook during the mvp era they insisted the team was total trash and would be dead last without him and yet old man cps thunder did better without paul george loli feel like the statement cant be applied to anybody ever if thats how youre defining it lol like i would consider the very beginning of the spurs dynasty to be the drafting of tim duncan not when they won their third ring i think the warriors dynasty started when steph was drafted they are the core of the dynastyin this case the start of their current era was when they decided to trade their aging stars and go young obviously they werent a dynasty the moment he got traded but that never really happens if they truly end up a dynasty it couldnt have started until after russ was goneso why did luka get dog walked in the first round last yeardeletedyou can be snarky all you want but i feel like i explained my take pretty well youre welcome to disagree im done replying to you because youre kind of a

       " 'kevin durant last season at the age of of course on top of his famous achilles injury years prior averaged ppg on ts he shot from just for shits and giggles his highest mark ever based on games played and volumewhat even is that so essentially was a yr stretch where we arguably saw the best individual seasons on offense primarily peak curry and kdyea that trackscan you check where any of shais seasons would becan you do this for ppg seasons as wellkd is so underrated now i saw a post where most people think jokic is already a great nba player than kd all timeeven though he has basically the same numbers it doesnt seem like his game translates to team success like it used toi think its more so telling of the relatively poor league average play versus the efficiencyanalytics playstyle revolution that very quickly happenedguys like kd harden kyrie dame klay and curry were peaking as shooters and embracing todays modern version of basketballmeanwhile the league average ts was still getting dragged down by shitty post ups from ss who had no business doing so and long s from role players shooting on themmost recent season was his highest ts ppg on tsif youre interested in finding these stats out yourself you can always check a players basketballreference page under the adjusted shooting secfionif youre wondering about giannis his last seasons for ts where he scored ppg were and hell probably never get much higher than that due to his below league average p and fti think if hes not already then hes close dont really think thats that insaneyou sre not underrated if jokic has surpassed you lol and he had for mostbecause he definitely is jokis is literally appearing on the only list kd is on while being the best passer and probably best rebounder of the generation and x mvp and actually carried a team to a ring and had indefinitely better post season performances only thing going on for kd is longevity otherwise theyre not similar nobody was ever scared of kd like of jokic in the playoffs teams are literally throwing everything they have on jokici mean its pretty close mvps and his ring is pretty equal to both of kds combined imo arguably morecomes down to personal criteria especially peak vs longevity regardless jokic is almost certainly a lock to pass kdabsolute craziness i still remember how the league dreaded kd no one can guard him and hes still knows how to score the best at every level i wont stop giving kd his flowers truly one of the most underrated players everlike zero scoringonly players are underrated not even close this is by far the most overrated type of playerhe is he scores like kd and passes like magic hes been the best player in the league for of the last seasons and led his team to a championship kds never been the best player in the league and hes never been the best player in a championship teamhonestly i think its pretty fair to say that each of jokics last seasons would beat out kds peak season of when he won mvp but got outplayed by westbrook in the playoffshes cant put pressure on the rim and beat hes man off the bounce like he could pre achilles hes just become a more efficient jump shooterive tried to qualifyreason out this feeling but its so hardlike his stats are as good as ever and hes legitimately just as effective as ever as putting the ball in the hoop in a vacuumbut watching the games his impact feels way less than his box scores would tell you but im not entirely sure why i dont think theres a quantifiable stat to point at and say this is why this isah yes thats a valid point a transition period in the league where pioneers shinedthank youhis ft is the most puzzling he was never great but it seems like its been getting worse every yearnot sure how you can indefinitely better postseason performances than kd in naw jokic ring was against pretty weak compdo you think kd is a oneway playerkd plays defense the jokic glaze is ridiculous i think he has a real argument over kd right now but lets not throw these disingenous arguments zero scoringonly player talking about kd like hes cam thomas is so disrespectfulhe does not score like kdstop it jokic isnt close to a scorer kd waslook i agree jokic is ahead of kd marginally all time but kd absolutely has been the best player in the league and the best player on a championship team the guy has an mvp and two finals mvps and no serious person would disagree that he deserved all three of those accoladesi agree on the flip side winning rings after joining a win team and being the only team in history afaik to be the better favorites against the field is even easier lolive watched his entire career his defense is fine goodgreat at times even but he has the habit of floating and being low energy on defense he has pretty much never taken difficult assignments and has hardly ever been much of a difference makerdefinitely not a liability but unless he is surrounded by great defenders he isnt moving the needle enough for it to matter as much as other guysi didnt say anything about jokickds defense is a lot more mediocre than it looks over his career yes he has good moments and has had solid years when surrounded by other great defenders doing all the difficult things he cantwontdoesnt do but he typically isnt engaged all game long and floatsrelaxes way more than he should if we are calling him a good defenderkd is amazing he just doesnt offer much outside of scoring hes not a playmaker and his defense is fine nothing disingenuous at allhes not cam thomas but of the top players of alltime hes the most one dimensional hes not a very good passer and he can easily be stripped of the ball his defense is above average just for an nba starter but hes not an impact defender like bron mj hakeem duncan kareem kg russell robinson cp giannis stockton wilt kawhi or westhe said close jokic had already shown when needed to score will score at will he jjst doesnt show it in the regular season as often as he should ppg on ts in the playoffs compared to ppg on ts for kd pretty much identical jokic would easily increase his scoring volume if he wasnt such an elite passerjokic for his career averages ppg on ts in the playoffs durant for his career averages ppg on ts in the playoffskd might be the better regular season scorer but you cant separate them when it matters kds also remarkably turnover prone for a guy who doesnt get a lot of assistsin kd has a deserved regular season mvp after which he shit the bed in the playoffs while lebron went nuclear leading a tired old heat team to the finals to make it very clear who the best player in the league wasthen he went to stephs team and was completely outclassed over the course of years making it very clear that he had nowhere near steph currys impact on a basketball floor the team went when steph played without kd and when kd played without stephbeing the top scorer in a couple noncompetitive finals against a ridiculously overmatched team doesnt change that the one time the warriors actually had their backs against the wall was when they went down to houston and in that series steph was still clearly the most important player in the clutchmaybe but rings are a team accomplishment anyways not like we use a conversion factor with anyone else are we gonna say magic had like rings due to having another goat candidate on his team does kobe have about rings due to having prime shaw is dirks rings worth like so hes same as magicso you think that fine goodgreat at times even defense qualifies someone as a scoringonly playerwhere is this close you are talking aboutno he literally didnt say closekd being turnover prone is a valid critiquefor the ts u gotta look at it relative to their competition team composition and league average looking at stats like this in a vacuum is meaningless do better little broworst take oata very young kd outplayed prime lebron in the nba finals after beating multiple dynasty teams to even make the finals versus lebron coasting in the weak east kd was widely considered better than steph when they played tgt and won fmvps even when he and the rest of the team wanted to get steph one obviously a team built around steph would perform worse when he is out versus kd but it is clear that kd was the better basketball playeri think kd is right on the edge help me out who are worse defenders that you consider way high level guys like ray allen im struggling to think of peoplehe also isnt much of a passerplaymaker and his ballhandling is elite for his size but he isnt breaking down the defense all game long he mostly gives you great scoringshooting it is incredibly valuable one of the best ever at there are just a lot of other ways great players provide value kds contributions are pretty narrow compared with other alltime greats and i am saying that this applies to basically every player with this sort of gameimpactim just saying kd in theory is definitely a way guy but kd in practice is at times and isnt at timesand its not close at all what are we doing here kd is one of the greatest scorers of all time the nature of their positions and how kd can move like a guard at his height just makes him such a better scorer than jokicthe team performed better with steph and no kd than they did when they played together with kd and no steph they were barely a playoff teamstephs offball movement and gravity get everyone else on the team open thats not something kd could do if he had the team built around him hes never been able to do it ever he doesnt have the impact of making everyone around him better offensively like steph or jokic he just gets hisin what world is outplaying with dpoy defense just nonsense if lebron was coasting and outplayed by kd why did he have much better statscorrelation causation i could also say the difference between kd and an average starter barnes was so great it brought the warriors from loss away from a wcf exit to the consensus greatest team of all timethats really difficult to quantify kd also has insane gravity and while steph off ball movement is better i dont think it makes up for the advantage in rebounding defence rim protection and scoring that kd hasbro what coasting would be exactly why he won especially in conjunction with hardens playlol congratulations on kd turning a win team into an alltime team by replacing harrison barnes pretty sure al horford could have done that just as wellso bron outplayed kd and easily beat him despite coasting listen to yourselfterrible take man yeah wins but very vulnerable in the playoffshistorically evidence would disagree lebron with another strong all star without replacing any starters couldnt even bring a playoff team into anywhere near the dominance of kd warriors i would think the kd and barnes wouldnt be as much as freely adding a goat candidate and another high tier all star even considering their records before it should be equal yet kd was wayy more dominant clearly kd and bron are at least in the same tierall of this is behind the point though you shifted your goal posts about times from your original claim that kd shit the bed and curry outplayed him ig ill accept this as you conceding your original take is indefensibledude no one coasts in the finals i obvs meant he had a much easier path making the finals allowing him to coast vs kd who went through probably the toughest conference oatso you agree he outplayed kd what kind of dumbass argument is this',\n",

       " 'no way a cheater is praising god because his snitch also got caught cheating lmaogod answers all prayersi like to imagine nick young sitting in a church praying for dlos downfall like eddie brock in spiderman year oldthis culture of blaming the person who speaks up rather than the behavior of the person getting exposed is insanewhat lack of accountability looks like in kinterviewing with pajamas on is wildwhy is nick young acting like he is an angelnick is such a clownthis is a funny ass interview format with all the bright ass lights and everyone trying not to laugh at how ridiculous it isits ok to laugh yallis swaggy nation in the room with us right nownick young is get those phones out of his facecan some eli i have no idea whats going onbraincells galorethis shit is hilarious

whatever but theyre both wrongthis isnt serious hes not being serious cmon now nick is a troll lmao this shit is hilariouspretty sure the term is cheaters never prosper there nickreading through the comments i fear for yall kids this clearly is satire well its not clear so im spelling it out nick thinks dlo got what was coming to him and they clowning himdidnt realize so many people were cool with snitches and snakes up in here even cheaters celebrate the downfall of cheatersthe cheater is at fault first step is to never cheatno one hates a snitch as much as a bully or a cartel there are times when it is correct for someone to snitchthis is like eddie brock praying to god for spidermans downfall in spiderman i just need you to fucking murder peter parker please god he stole the woman

shitnick makes me laugh so much hes honestly a lovable guy but i wish he would get over this shit its been fuckin years over a woman he clearly didnt care about enough to not cheat on get over itare people really getting mad at nba players for cheating cmon nowa circle jerk of moronic drivel nobody cares about or wants to hearwho the fuck cares what nick young says in any conversation who is looking for nick youngs opiniongod answers all prayers god aint let you keep iggy azalea thosnitching is legit worse than murder for some people its wild lolnick is a king clowngod answers all prayersdear god please help me take revenge on this dude who exposed me for cheating on my girlfriend and hiding ityeah dont think god works like thatthis is literally when eddie brock was praying for vengeance on toby mcguire spider manwhats the new situation i havent seen it posted anywhere i know the original dlo swaggy kerfuffle of courseeven job wasnt asked to snitchoh of course he is its just like diddy thanking god when he was acquitted on the more serious chargeswhoever leaked this will get snitched on and itll keep getting passed along like final destinationwhat percentage of nba players are faithful to their girlfriendsmysterious ways or somethingif you aint cheating you aint tryinhold uphe dropped to his knees and pointed straight to the sky when he heard the newsbro victimizing himself because he got caught cheating after someone snitched lmaooo his cheating was fine apparently the snitching was the problemall them nba dudes are professional dirty mackersnick got non real championship ringu think god cares if you cheat on iggy thats gods beautiful plan for nickas an aside never have i seen greater hating in a movie than that lol and the film is years old must have just seen bruce almightythe crossover i never knew i needed thank youthis just blew my mind bro is more like nick olddlo was when that happened tooyou idiots do know this is a joke and hes trolling rightim always amazed when women go fight the girl who was cheating with their man instead of the man himselfthe worst part is the hypocrisysimilar to people who catch their spouse cheating and go after the other person dude that person was just tryna get laid your wifehusband is the one that broke your trustsecretly recording your friend and posting it behind their back is not speaking upcalling him out to his face and saying cheating is wrong would be actually standing up for somethingim more shitty about invoking a supreme being as a get out of jail free card that takes a level of stupid that i cant wrap my mind aroundhe didnt even expose it on purpose wasnt he hacked or something this i never understood why dlo always gets roasted for the incident yet everyone treats swaggy as the victimnarcissism is a personal disorder that rarely goes treated and is often encouraged for the wealthyit makes sense if youre nick young or a lakers fan who actually didnt care about nick young cheating on his girlfriend but did care about lockerroom drama affecting their team if dangelo actually cared about the cheating he wouldve sent it to iggy not posted it onlineits shit just breeds terrible people and makes people afraid to be truthfulits not logical its emotional behavior easier to be mad at someone that you dont know even if they dont deserve itits gotten a bit out of hand certainly but dont forget the roots of where such a culture came from it was totally necessary to hold snitches accountable in just about all disenfranchised groups until the st centuryyou know whats crazy as far as i remember dlo didnt even post the shit on purpose and according to gil they both had crazy videos of each other saying shit on his phone imo he wanted to be the fun vet like gil was to him and got caught upinsane but so fucking funnythe worst is weve lost all semblance of what snitch means a snitch is someone who participated in the act and then gave up his coconspiratiors not someone who merely reports the crimecertain sectors of society have this mentality some culturally ingraineddidnt dangelo expose just so he could get with the girlwhos mad at the girl for sharing the dmswhy cant both be blamed it isnt one or the otherbruh aint nobodies place to insert themselves as a white knight in other peoples affairsdlo was wrong as a guy to do that happy he has falleni believe in blaming the person who speaks up because frankly its none of their business nor their place to try and expose someone cheating is bad and cheaters deserve to have a stigma attached to their name once their partner finds out but i believe its for the partner to find out themselves not to have it put out on social media or have someone else insert themselves into that couples personal lifei can only imagine you in real life yelling and standing up for every wrong you sound like someone with a lot of cool friendsits loser behavior russell was barely past being a teenager has maintained that he didnt know how it got off his phone and onto the internet and young was caught on the home security camera bringing dates to his fiances house anyway the lack of accountability as you said is off the charts especially when you remember that part of the storykobe actually did the thing that youngs still just theorizing about ten years later but you dont see shaq contentfarming it because hes not a loseri remember when the nick young thing happened he wasnt very discreet tmz was gonna expose that dude if dlo didnt and dlo was bound to get exposed hes cheating with an onlyfans chickpeople have been wearing these since the pandemic i see many high schoolers walking to school in them every day i want to yell out that we were wearing skidz in the late sjust the kind of intimate experiences you get with elite journalists like these guyshe is simply dumb as fuck like we dont need to overcomplicate thisfor one he is dumb aint no way he thinks god would answer his prayersbecause its fucking funny have you heard of humormore than a clown he is a cheater fuck him and any other adulterous personyeah this comment section is way too serious for this dumb shiti had to scroll way too far for this the situation has been a joke for like a decade lmaoi think redditors have a tendency to completely miss social queues this interview is set up to be purposefully ridiculous and halfway through you can see nick and one of the interviewers trying not to laugh and for some reason everyone in this thread thinks they are being seriousdudes be taking shit too serious lmao nick is a trollremember the actual demographic of rnba and it starts to make sensepeople are acting like they are a media member forced to make a statement saying they do not condone this newsflash your still a fat white dude on an anonymous reddit account its okyeah this is all obvious joking around and its hilarious yall are way too seriousremovedduring his rookie season angelo recorded a video of nick talking about cheating on iggy azalea his fiancee at the time they were doing pranks to each other but the video was leakedlmao exactlyat least a thousand people care counting you too and me obviouslyi mean dlo snitchedd lo got caught allegedly cheatingdlo was the one who snitched on nick young cheating on piggy azalea when they were both on the lakersnick young used to be tight with russell until thenand hasnt liked him sincebut this is probably more of him trolling about the situation since he likes to joke aroundcalling someone out for performatively disavowing something is itself a form of performatively disavowing something pquit microagressing me with your privilege you fascistdlo filmed him and posted it on the internet without his knowledge doesnt really matter what nick didthis is very true its a big issue when you think about it its hard to improve things when a lot of people are walking around leaving criminals be no snitching is a huge setbackyou guys just need to laugh at this or just dont give a fuck its okaythe fact u did research on how much both of those guy made based on video like this is pretty sad filled out job application or somethingim pretty sure his imaginary sky wizard is different from your imaginary sky wizard so it will all be okay i can assure you neither one of these people will wind up in hellwhat part of the bible did you read that said you cant cheat on a girlfriendwtf is wrong with you bro cheating on someone should get you sent to a hellyeah i feel like nick wont care and already knows he going where he going monogamy is a societal construct most animals have many different partners god dgafdonefumbledis that really a fumble she fucking succccckkkks this isnt like ime udokas fumbleja morantwasnt that malik monk or did swag tell that to malikbig facts they did not have friends growing up and were never picked for sports teamsshits crazy lol imagine defending that type of snake behavior nick was wrong too but i feel like people are forgetting what dlo actually didhonestly my biggest problem with dlo was just about how he went about the whole situation if he had a problem with nick young cheating there are better ways to handle it than posting a video online while laughing about the situation that kind of stuff can be dealt with privatelyif iggy wasnt aware of the situation before that im also sure thats not how she wanted to hear about it for the st timei completely agree with you one way to improve the community is to get rid of no snitching ofcourse i understand that some may be scared but you operating on the mind your business mindset will come back around to you if everyone thinks that way one day you will likely need help too have to look out for each otherits not about the lack of holding ppl accountable its about not allocating said accountability to ppl outside of our community who dont have our best interest at heartcorrectpossiblyincorrectthat was the second prayer he answeredthe floods and the famine can wait for theres a cheating snitch out there that needs to be exposeddear lord please fuck dangelo up for me just one time mess his life up good amengod answered but the answer was nothat dusty ah bih aint from the lordthes already dealing with a child named gilbert he probably didnt want two of themthats an answered prayer we gonna see if years how much god saved himleft him just to have a kid with a man that abandoned hershe has fallen way off since she was with nick dodged a bullletummmthats a good thingshe of ho now she everyones girl he got out just in timeremember camron saying he wouldnt say anything if he found out a serial killer lived next to him hed just move or somethingmfs just ignorant and proud of italso he did not snitch his phone got hackedhim and no chill gil are peak nba podcast brainrotnick young is not praying nor religious lol its just a sayingbut it does it says in the bible chapter verse and god spoken unto man and said snitches get stitchestopher grace asking god to kill spiderman energygod killed a followers son so he could win a bet with the devil that he wouldnt curse god god is about that lifethe bet was for bragging rights btwthat said his first son was washed anyway god gave him new sons dude took a former highly ranked prospect and flipped him for sons that turned out even better literally per the text lmao id take this dude as my gmif he doesnt answer prayers during slavery or any other heinous times maybe he does work like thatwell god didnt hate immigrants either and launch them to whatever country a blindfolded ice agent landed on while spinning a globe i dont think he hated democrats either or loved guns or encourage people to pay for a pastors private jet or sent a pedophile to lead the united states while were at itsure he does god is currently helping evangelicals protect the president who hurt children with jeffrey epstein protecting a cheater like nick is light work for godlex luthor in superman conan the barbarian prayer to cromeddie brock praying for god to kill peter parker is definitely up thereyou need to watch more movieslooks much younger also speaks acts and exhibits intelligence that is way way below kids really have no concept of what being means and i understand but just give it timethe way ive always looked at it is like this you cheat with someone i know friend acquaintance family then i gotta go see that person you cheat with a random person off the street or someone you met online then god bless both you and im moving on with my lifei mean men do that tooi always though the same thing but when i was like i saw my on and off gf with some dude i already had some beef with and i hit him idk dumb move for sure shouldve just moved on it kinda felt good cause i really hated that dude tho but it wasnt worth it lolit happens with men too but i think its like an i need to prove im better than you type of thing like they feel like theyve been made inferior or been replaced and they need to prove that idea wrongwhy i feel like thats not surprising at allare you surprised most men will also go for the man firstif someone took your sandwich would you punch the person who took your sandwich or would you punch the sandwichi understand because the bf usually gets his ass beating later a woman knows both the cheating bf and the whore who sleeps with a taken man which is also wrong deserves an ass beating and she also know she wont get another chance to seebeat her asswhats amazing is the double standards in america when it comes to cheating a cheated woman can beat their bf tell the world and plot a sickest revenge but a cheated man cant even lightly slap a woman even if she becomes conceived lolthanks normgilbert arenas has basically all but said that both dlo and nick did the secret recording shit to each othermakes sense why nick wouldnt wanna openly say that tho cause it makes this whole situation look stupid from his endhe didnt post anythingits the culture of thinking the people who report others doing morally wrong actions are the problem rather than the people who are committing the actionsespecially since hes not a goddamn victim in any waygood baitthey were mad at dlolots of mentheres a root issue at play and then theres everything else lolhow is the partner supposed to find out when everyone is protecting the cheaterlmao why all you said here was that they shouldnt because its inserting themselves into their livesyeah dude i insert myself into my friends lives all the time to try to help them out because i love them and want the best for them nothing at all wrong with thatnah fuck the cheater slander their name not cheating is easier than doing it it is their business since they are the ones affected by a shitty persons decisionwhat if you found out one of your acquaintances was scamming money from one of your close friends you still hold this positionthis is the logic of a pedophile protectorstanding up against things that are wrong is a bad thing nowyou seem like youre devoid of any sense of moralitylisten man if you caught your friend cheating on their partner and you said nothing youre a piece of shit simple as thati can imagine you in real life watching a child get raped and not doing anything about itkobe ratted me out its why im getting divorced fact this this is even a topic years later is really the pathetic part guy has the balls to say the streets feening to know fuck outta heredamn this is like much worseshaq is a loser thoughusually a trashy white girlcant be overstated like even by professional athlete standards nick young is really fucking dumbthis is itthis sub really has no sense of humoriq mfers when literally anything well godcheating is obviously terrible but im not gonna get that mad about entertainers i will never know or meet cheatingcheating on iggy azalea with his high school girlfriendbaby mama was weirdly probably best for everyone in that situation though since he ended up going back to the old girlfriendoh no someone cheated how terribleits what kills reddit it would be as big as ig if the commenters werent always trying to be so holier than thou and hating on everythingwith the demographics of this sub are you surprised got mofos talking about child rape in here like wtfi never seen celebritypublic figure talks about their cheating scandal like this with comedy format it was years agoyet redditors are the one who still feel a type of way abt this lmaoall the subreddits are turning into snark subreddits every point of conversation turns into what political party the belong to or the things theyve done in the past not discussing the product or allowing other people to enjoy the product in front of themthe spectrum and redditors have an overlap that is why we see on reddit alot of people who have no clue how social interactions happen in real life these people are way to serious about the smallest thingsdeletedgoing off this the vast majority of this subreddit are now year old white men use this logic for basically all of reddit you start to understand a lot of the comments here when you view them from that lensrealfactsyoure calling out reddit when there is a social media platform where a year old former bench player who nicknamed himself swaggy p and whos greatest accomplishment was cheating on a one hit wonder australian rapper has a million followerscalling out the entirety of reddit while using fucking reddit and saying yall as if you arent is a wild thing to doeh you gotta be a little delusional to expect someone outside of your relationship to help you protect the dirt youre throwing on that very same relationship like cheating on his girl is what gave dlo the ammo to expose that he was checks notes cheating on his girli just dont know if its a legit snitch i dont remember it too well but to snitch there needs to be intent to inform another persongroup about things your current groupperson did like is it snitching if you spill gossip about a coworker you arent tight withdubai chocolate matcha labubus got me tweakin twini wouldnt even classify what he did as research what he did was just straight up pocketwatchingremovedpretty sure its implied in the commandmentsadultery is literally one of the commandmentsadultery is a sinit is one of the ten commandments do you not know what the ten commandments are im not religious and think its all bullshit but yes cheating on someone known as adultery is one of the things that gets you sent to hell but you also dont have to be religious to think that cheating on someone is scummy as fuck and should get someone branded as a shit bagits one of the ten commandments loli mean people get sent there for lessaccording to some teachingsyes are you a christian how do you not know that adultery is a sin its in the ten commandmentslmao of the things god gives a fuck about per the bible are societal constructs thats not an argumentyou would crack if she let you you know itwhat did he actually do make public that a guy was cheating when he factually wasim fine with that dont cheat and its not an issuedlo didnt post the video lol his icloud was hacked and someone else got their hands on it dlos crime was having a video not posting itif you are a man and you are not very good friends or related to the woman being cheated on and the man cheating on her is your friend or teammate you dont snitch on him and if you must if you really think god is gonna let you into heaven a little faster for your heroic actions you sneak the info to one of her friends and then let her sort it outpeople outside the community arent the ones actively making it violent and uninhabitableletting thieves murderers and rapists continue to have carte blanche to behave free of consequence in your neighborhood isnt working years of objective data says it isnt workingi looked her up and i thought i was looking at a different person no hate but its wild how modern plastic surgery makes everyone look the samedear sweet lord please let that asshole who snitched me for cheating also cheat and get caught thank you good lordi dont know if you know any bible stories but god has gotten into some petty shit this wouldnt be out of character dude told his biggest fan to kill his son for himprioritiesdlo has been traded to the timberwolveslike that scene from spiderman where eddie brock goes to church to pray for peters downfallme when i have absolutely no contact with womeni think she already shut it downincel type shitdeletedshe put him before her career thats how much she liked him dude is a clownyou get the very environment you allowthats legit tho some ppl just mind their own businessmad weird to record itnick always sounds drunk af on there its kinda sadjudas did get his shit pushed in thats true says smoke weed everydayyou okayyou obviously never read the book of job god took a loyal good natured holy person and killed his wife and children crippled him and ripped off his skin just to prove a point to satan that he would still love him if he did all thatwrong subsir are you gonna order somethinglight work for your mom you meanhavent seen it yet but that sounds spoton for lex hes a pathetic haternicholas hoult as lex luthor stole that movie ngl that man exudes pure hater energy for no reason and it made me lowkey root for him lex shed tears at the end cuz superman won ive never seen a bigger hater movei thought hed be max lolthe guy is literally named youngwith how social media is going dont they ever will lol you have year olds pan handling on the internet now dignity and self respect have left the chatwhat if theyre both really really sorrythis makes more sensemost logicalalso i feel like women have an unspoken code of hey you knew i was dating this guy and you still pursued and fucked him have some fucking self respect and thats where the anger comes fromwhen its random people that other person may have no ideaits not really what usually happens thoughyou gotta go see them and do what classic redditor misdirected anger my chick would chop my dick off i bet all the women who do that had parents who cheatedthis is dumb id punch the person who gave my sandwich away nobody stole the sandwich and you probably didnt pay attention in school past fourth graderelating person to a sandwich is crazy work lola sandwich is an object that one could claim ownership ofhumans are a little bit more capable of making their own decisions and a little less like someone elses propertythis has got to be the dumbest take ive ever read on anything im sorry ur parents and the schooling system wherever u live failed u so badly lmaoi cant answer this until you tell me the type of sandwichthe sandwich doesnt have a will of its own you cant compare the situations come onthis goes hard if you dont think about itjust say you wanna hit womenthere are non physical ways to get back at a cheating woman i would say succeeding in life with a trusted partner is the ultimate revengeok that explains the sneaking to record part but how did the video get off of dlos phone and onto the internet he trip fell and hit send by mistakeproviding someone a video to post on their account is the same exact betrayalnot bait truthwhat nick young did was fucked up but recording your teammate without his consent and leaking the convo is also very fucked up like players cheat all the time it doesnt make it normal or any good but its not like he was doing anything illegal snitching on your teammate rarely happens and which is why majority sided with nick youngsame thing when kobe snitched on shaqcatch the person slipping all cheaters slip up eventuallyyou must have misunderstood its not the business of anyone not in the relationship of course its the business of the person being cheated on but i still believe its for them to find out themselves not for someone else to tell thembut its not your business the false sense of morality is the issuerightnot my business to insert myself into their life lmaothis analogy is bollocks imo dlo and iggy had no relationship whatsoever and scamming someone out of money is not the same as getting side if dlo was close friends with iggy and not nick then i can see that but telling business that isnt yours is tacky but he was young so its understandableyeswhy are we equating adultery to pedophiliadude life is full of grey areas man im old enough to know now that staying out of relationship issues is bestdepends on situation completely it really doeslmao wow jump to conclusions haha cheating is equal to child rape to you ok manthis is still funny all these years later the whole crowd getting into it was good his face the first time he says it is wildoh my god kobe how my ass tastei knew of this line but never actually watched the whole rap this was legit in light of his shenanigans with poop that line takes on a different meaning unless that stuff was obvious at the timetheres no more games till october rnba is desperate for content guy has the balls to say the streets feening to know fuck outta hereuhhh yeah theyre literally doing a comedic bit to poke fun at how dumb it all is by pretending its very serious news that theyre doing a serious official press conference aboutand it was like the top post on this dumb ass subreddit for like most of the day so apparently he wasnt wronglmao i couldnt believe my eyes when i read that shaqs the most successful loser of all timeapparently notdeletedbeing an idiot is only so funny hes only funny because of how dumb he is not like hes some comedic genuisdeletedsame to put a finer point on it cheating is a betrayal of a social contract but the reality is the contract terms for celebrities are pretty fundamentally different in a lot of cases like clearly many of them are functionally open marriagesthe thing i have a big problem with is people that went after dlo for doing tje right thing see something say something and stay wokedeletedbecause instagram comment sections are so greatyoure right i used the wrong word thanks for the correction those ones view the front page thoughwe aint beating the tism allegations fami think the average well adjusted person would say his biggest accomplishment is making it to the nba winning a ring and making million dollars in career earnings but im not going to stand in the way of your delusion enjoy your weekend bruh loliggy was not a one hit wonder she has songs in the top of billboard songs that have charted some better than others ofcoursei think she put nick young first though which imo really messed up her momentum especially when he ended up cheating on herbro whether youre fine or not with cheating recording a private convo with a friend and exposing it is weird as hell if he wasnt admitting to a messed up crime theres no reason to exposenobody asked the dude to protect anything just dont go making a video of a private conversation and then share it i also dont understand why people are so upset swaggy is happy to see d in the same boat clearly hes happy to see a hypocrite get exposed who wouldnt beno one talks about thati dont care what you think about nick young as a persondlo snitched he recorded private conversation and the conversation was leaked that is snitched it is what it isyeah but why your boys exposing anything thats why hes a snitch lol nobody wants their friends to turn into rats as soon as they do something wrong in their presencedude secretly recorded him and asked him questions about it for like five minutes straight nick young is a dumbass for not figuring out something was up but dlo was snitching with intentgreat you gave me the link where i talk about basketball statistics about basketball stuffim not doing research how much grown ass men made based on celebrity relationship drama you seems insecure about moneythous shalt not covet thy neighbors wifepretty sure you can cheat on your girlfriends just not your wife unless she lets you or its with her sister something like thatadultery is for marriagedoesnt matterits all made up bs anyway but even if it were real the church has been pretty clear that sinners dont go to hellyeah something tells me uafterfee aint a fundamentalist loladultery is between married couples they were not married at this point so he would technically not be breaking a commandmentsomething tells me you didnt know that before reading the replies lolthats for marriagewait are you even part of our community wait i just saw your fingers lol stay outta this one porkythey all look like an instagram filter its really creepy i often wonder if its possible to ever revert your face back to how it was before as its going to look diabolical over time as they agewas surprised to see that shes an of model nowabraham was really surprised as it is written in the holy scripture god said to abraham kill me a son abe said man you must be puttin me on god said no abe said whatstory of job is just wild and i dont know how anyone can not feel sick reading ittheres a reason new testament god becomes a lot nicerthere was that prophet who shaved bald elisha i think some youths were mocking him so he got a bunch of bears to go maul them kings that was messing up our lives not hiseddie brock really was a d hater before it was a thing going to an empty church to pray on a mans downfall is revolutionaryi have no clue what iggy does on of but assuming its porn then no not wanting to date a girl who does that is perfectly reasonable lmaowhat part what normal man is ok with his girlfriend being on onlyfansnot wanting your girl to hoe herself out to the world is normal bruh get out of here with that hippy shitbruh if everyone sees your girls titties she not your girlhow is that incel lol imma never tell my girl how to dress or anything like that but onlyfans cmon nowabsolutely true its just very unattractive from a significant other perspective she should for sure have the rightna if you know your next door neighbour is a serial killer for a fact and you say nothing you pretty much aiding themwhat a stupid fuckin commentimagine slurping nick young oofits very entertaining and likable how much of a hater he is in the movie they nailed the depiction of him as a characterwhen the reverse flash comes to the big screen yall will see what real hating looks likeyeah for sure luckily ive never been cheated on but thats the way i would approach itbring up the betrayal end the friendship and get some closure or is that too immaturelmfaofight id guessbrother thinks someone is incapable of being mature about a situation because they are on reddit no did you think they meant they were going to beat someone up classic redditor unable to use context cluesi mean maybe you feel its misdirected but its not that surprising that someone would be mad at the person who slept with their so its not like you have to pick one person to be mad atwe are talking about crazy people rightwouldnt you expect a crazy person to think like a crazy personsure people dont act like they own their partnerjust ignore human historythe sandwich can make you and your descendants richand the odds of getting another sandwich that can do that are very slimdo you think the people that attack their partners mistress are thinkingthey are feeling and they feel someone took something from themits not right it just issurely either that or i think you american men let women go way too fari agree just walking away and not looking backdidnt he get hacked or something like thathe got hacked lmao it was pretty much the story at the time and no one has ever disputed thatyoud think if that it wasnt a hack nick wouldve said so by now seeing as hes openly talking about it besides when gil alludes to him also participating in the secret recording loljust use your head what possible reason would dlo have to do that lmao especially now that hes caught cheating obviously wasnt a moral issue the hacked story makes sense and it doesnt make any sense to come up with some head canon for a situation no one disputeshe said someone got into his phone somehow which frankly i tend to believe himwhat motivation could he have possibly had to get that video out there and make himself look like a weirdo snitch that secretly records peoplewhy in the world would he possibly want to trash his personal reputation forr what exactly nick young to maybe but maybe not break up with his girlfirend bc shes mad at him nowseriously whats the motivehe didnt do that eitherits the business of the person being cheated on so they should be given all information about it nodawg what you are saying the person making it public deserves blame for making it public they dont deserve any blame the solution is simple dont cheat and you wont be viewed publicly as a shitty person if i know someone is cheating on their partner i will speak up and say something ill hold any of my friends accountable for some dumb shit like that because cheating is the easiest thing to avoid i believe it is my job as a decent human being to hold people who are shitty people accountablenever said it was my business if the person who gets cheated on chooses to expose a dumb ass let them expose them that manwoman that got cheated on is now making it public and i can now critique the dumb ass for cheatingfuck that noise i wish someone had exposed my cheater ex would have saved years of depression and wasted money adult relationships are serious investments in time emotions and money cheaters dont deserve some magical protectioni wasnt trying to make an analogy i was responding to the logic that comment was using particularly this part that you highlighted scamming someone out of money is not the same as getting side is it how so and do you think youre in the majority or minority hereglad you aint my friendpathetic lack of a backbonebecause the logic of snitches get stitches or its none of your businesscheating is a grey area tells me all i need to know about you tbhyoure going out of your way to berate someone for supporting snitches whats wrong with being morally rightand how is your comment criticizing them any different from what they are doing youre both pushing your morals on othersand yeah anyone who thinks snitches should get stitches supports pedoshow about just do the right thingi cant ever get over the guy who says what in the background when he says hes better than karemna it was like that passive aggressive drake kanye beef his teammates knew exactly what he was talking abouti mean i added other groups to it but i deleted it guess i shouldve kept in my whole comment to spread the love to all of gods peoplei get you guys dont like himyou guys are like the saudi morality police its not that serious people here are more upset about cheating than the people cheated on its weirdyea it really is a different world for them for whatever reason if i didnt watch or listen to any entertainer that is a cheater id get bored pretty quicklysure thats true about celebrities in generalit was certifiably not true in nick youngs casecant have been good for locker room chemistry though so i get where some of the criticism came from it was also pretty humiliating for iggy azalea which was unfair to her theres a difference between saying something to iggy privately and exposing everything publiclyembarrassing mansure buddy loltheyre pretty dumb but they arent stuck up would you want to hang with your cousin whos funny but a little dumb and annoying or your cousin whos cool and smart but always correcting you and acting like their shit dont stinki guess at least autistic people have more self awareness than nick youngmy delusion that caring what nick young says is weird lol id argue that most rational well adjusted people dont get upset about off hand comments about nick young but i guess here we both are have a good oneyea but if it was actually leaked i think there should be some leeway therengl bro if i find out my homie is cheating i aint protecting his ass but thats just mepersonally im not covering up for a friend cheating especially if i know and am friendly with their partner i dont want to be friends with shitty people if youre going do that shit you better not be letting me know either not saying thats what happened here just generallynah he wasnt if you were around at the time they would post secret recordingspranks of eachother all the time as they were room mates they used to get posted on rlakers at the time tooyou actually seem insecure about itand whos wife was sheim pretty sure you arent religious lolwell to be fair they were engagedthe commandments are essentially a list of things that you cant do or youll go to hell its pretty concisegreat counter you got himok then pre marital sex it is thengod no but you already knew that dont deflect data is data go ahead and call me what you wanna call me lol i know youre itching toyou cant really go back once youve cut into bone the bone is goneyeah theres implants but as long as you know when to stop it shouldnt be a problem as you age unfortunately people with too much money and not enough sense seem to rarely know when to stopthe most frightening thing is the lip filler i thought it was a rich people celebrity thing until i saw my sister in law walk in with those duck lips im like damn man how can anybody think this looks goodthey look scarier in personyoure surprised a washed fame whore turned into an actual onefuck me thats funny yeah jesus was basically a huge reformistincel type shit lol lots of men are way into itincel type shitwhy stop there i dont even let my girl show her ankles to the worldincel type shitsharing is caringincel type shit if you ever fix yourself and get a gf i bet youd be so embarrassed to have ever thought like thisits the way hes saying it that gives off incel bruh talks like hes already mad at hypothetical women which is a dead giveaway of a borderline intelligent at leasta soul for a soulimagine slurping your mom you meani liked how he was smart enough to understand the jealousy and fear behind why he irrationally hated superman but was so much of a hater he chose to disregard his self awareness and continue hatingthe monkey joke reminds me of lebron haters onlinei agree with this but i am just going to add that youre not going to get much closure from that interaction not saying you shouldnt have it just that closure is not going to come from therebe more mad at the betrayer the other person may not even know your so was in a relationshipseek helpi need to get me that sandwichhacked right lolno they should not be given any information its their business as in its their situation not yours so you shouldnt be putting yourself in it unless something illegal is going downi believe it is my job as a decent human being to hold people who are shitty people accountablewould you be so kind as to share all of the transgressions of you and your friends family with us redditors id like to know of shitty things theyve doneyes the person making it public deserves blame for making it public i really dont get whats so hard to understand about that unless the conduct is illegal theres no reason to be inserting yourself into other peoples personal lives like thatoh i thought you were referring to someone outside of the relationship on that point i agree with you if youre in the relationship the choice is yoursusing the logic from one argument and transferring it to another is called analogical reasoning aka an analogy so yes you were clearly trying to make an analogy and i thought it was a bad one with all due respectto use a saying there are levels to this shit i dont want to defer to common sense that stealing money from someone an actual crime is not in the same strata as being unfaithful to a partner moreover is it morally reprehensible sure but not to the same degree to which group majority or minority that opinion belongs im not sure of nor do i particularly care but to humor you ill say it depends on which group is being askedwell pedophilia is illegal so its okay to report that to the authorities in a way telling on someones personal life isnt unless you are a part of that type of life gang member some other criminal enterprise then snitches get stiches doesnt apply its none of your business does apply though because once again thats someone elses life not yoursyup it is man so if your friend is dating someone and says he see no future just wants sex you going to tell the girlstaying out of peoples relationships should be the standard cheating is so contextual if it was between my friends i would say something maybe if its between a friend and stranger im not saying anythingfor me its shaq bragging that he lives next to diddy oh definitely nick young sucks no question there i was just talking general reaction to hearing about celebrities cheatingim not saying go out of your way to protect him but my friends better not record me doing some shit and then get hacked lol difference between not announcing my shit to the world and actively lying or helping meare yall purposely ignoring the fact he secretly recorded him lol lying and protecting him is one thing secretly recording him then exposing it is a completely different thingif you think it literally meant only wives you havent done even the most basic religious scholarship or looked into even the tiniest bit of church doctrine on the subject so maybe stop talking on things you know nothing aboutisnt that like the th stepits not plenty of xtians interpret things differentlytyimagine immigrating to a country and complaining about the ppl who been here get outta here then if its so badyeah as far as i understand theres no such thing as reversing plastic surgery if you dont like how you look the surgeon is just gonna cut and mold again your face again to something elsewhats crazy is that lip fillers dont even last that long i was talking to a female friend and she said those injections only last about a year or so before you have to go in to get them againtbf she probably doesnt actually do porn shell do lingerie shots i imagine and becuase of her fame shell get a few thousand subsincel alertbig my dad was a dick so im not gonna be a dick energysounds like some goonersimp shit good luckincel how what do you think incel meansbeing into it is weird being against it is less weird but still weird a normal person should support their girl but they dont gotta be into itwhat about her eyes though what if a random man sees her eyes and cant control himself it would be her faultankles are the same as boobs huhsorry you dont like my not wanting people i date to whore themselves out on the internet for moneyi get what you are saying but it wasnt hypothetical he was talking about iggy and hes right she isnt much of a treasure if she selling herself on onlyfans i dont think that should be so controversial to sayboringim convinced most of those jokes like that monkey bot joke were subtle references to elon muskthe closure would come from standing up for yourself from the process and not the outcome of the interactionif the person didnt know then sure but thats not always the case either im just saying being mad at both people is a normal human reaction and you shouldnt be that amazed by itman what a truly underdeveloped sense of morality you haveif you knew one of your best friends was getting cheated on youd keep that to yourselfthe person who is being cheated on or who has proof of someone cheating on their partner and exposes it deserves no blame anyone who cheats deserves every ounce of blame and shame they get theres absolutely zero reason to cheat again fuck the cheaters if i am being cheated on i would pray someone tells me whether they have a part in it or not its called be a decent human being i dont understand whats so hard to understand about thatya exactly its so easy to not cheat man just say no or breakup with your partner and proceed to be singleok lemme clarify i wasnt making any analogy or reference to the actual dloiggyyoung situation only between cheating and a similar situation between friends to try and tease out what differences they saw in each and to that point lets keep the situations as similar as possible lets say no actual crime was committed between the acquaintancefriend just a scam in the sense that the acquaintance is lying to your friend about it and you happen to know that its a lie like your friend gave the money thinking it was for i dunno critical surgery but then the acquaintance actually used it for something frivolous i expect most people would tell their friend about it or confront the acquaintance to come clean but thats the decision i was trying to tease out and if you look at the commenters response to mine they are clearly in the other campwow your argument is just straight up that cheating really isnt that bad thats uhhhh thats really something budif someone was cheating on me i would want to know i wouldnt give that snitch stitches for telling me even though its none of their business to tell me because im morally consistent i dont think snitches deserve stitches lolwhat does that have to do with cheating lmao or this situation with nick youngcheating is wrong if you agreed with your so that you arent going to put your dick in anyone else and then you put your dick in someone else youre a liar and betrayed their trust luckily theres a simple solutionbreak up with the first person first if you fail to do that thats on you and its wrongno grey area therewould you want a stranger to tell you if your girl cheated on you or do you have a submission kink and like being cheated onfair enough friend thats legityou idiots never get the story straight dlo never leaked it he was hacked and it got outif you think it didnt then you dont know how to readquick question how do you feel about the part where those of a different sexual preference are abominationswell that certainly doesnt matter you obviously dont know shitwhat denomination of christianity is nick young a part of that doesnt believe in the ten commandments lmaotf you talking about lmaolike th generation american lollol only boys call it simping or gooning yall are jacking off to it but trying to be cool on heresupport their girls porn career normal person wherelol theres no such things as normal in a sexual andor romantic relationship thats a notion no intelligent or rational adult would haveonce upon a time yesimma be honest its the way youre framing it that comes across as incel type shit you can just say you prefer your girlfriendwife to keep her sexual side private without calling people whoressorry you cant see how you sound insecure but i wont waste time talking about the nuances of this situation lunch is almost done cooking so i have better things to do that talk to reddit wallsshe posts some nudes photos and made million a month allegedly any woman clearing almost million a month in income is a treasure point blank first offalso tying a womans value as a personpartner to how they express themselves sexually or whatever is indeed incel shit like yall are calling this woman a slut and ho when you do not know her or who she is as a personyou seem kinda mad my manlol best thing about that joke is you can use it across social mediasure but even then wouldnt you be more mad at your cheating partneri would id console them after if theyd like but wouldnt feel like its my place to tell them anythingonce again as i said stitches get stiches only applies to people who are living criminal lives i am also morally consistent in that if the conduct is not illegal then other people shouldnt be inserting themselves into the situationyes you just sound naive to relationships in the world its very all grey areas when it comes to relationships manyea good for the stranger but does the stranger know both of us in a personal way or no lots of gray areas also i never cheated and ive been cheated on ive also gotten involved before too and knew both parties with that being said i should have stayed out of it if there children involved that changes things toolike i said its very contextualwhy was he recording it anyway dumbass do you record conversations with your friendswhy was it on his phone to begin withi hate it im an atheist lmaobut if youre going to spout off about the meaning of religious doctrine at least take the time to actually familiarize yourself with said doctrinei doidk and idcyea th generation immigrant your family came here and youre complaining about ppl who have been here long before your people came here if you have such a problem why dont you go back to where your family immigrated from where everyone does what you wantreplace normal with sane then normal is relative to a situation it isnt specific things there is a middle ground between of refusing to date someonelet someone you date do of and being into it is all i was trying to sayok il call a duck a dog to make you happyahhh the old youre insecure as i make no tangible argument and wont explain why how secure behaviori am not calling her a slut nor a hoe that would indicate shes a prostitute which shes not however i wouldnt wanna date someone whos selling herself like that having values isnt incel behavior incel literally means hating on women because we get rejected and dont have sex thats not relevant lolboringim saying you shouldnt be amazed or shocked that the person who got cheated on is mad at both peopleyou are a shit friend thank god i dont have people like you in my lifeyoure a garbage friendso if your girl was cheating on you you wouldnt want someone to tell you if its none of their business thats sub kink behavior but hey i wont kick shamelol im not at all naive about relationships i just know cheating is wrong for the reasons i outlined abovebold of you assuming that i dont know the doctrineive forgotten more about it than youll ever knowand i said what i saidhmmmost people dont want to live in violent chaos if youre happy then keep on keeping onbut you have already determined in your mind that i am this guy so youre unwilling to have a good faith conversation lolbuhbyeunsurprisingly even more ignorant lol truly believing its insane to be freaky is hilariousincel type shitagain you never had the option to date this woman so you are getting up in arms about a hypothetical woman who you had no chance of interacting with doing something values are meant to apply to your own personal life not to be forced upon and used to demean othersthis is incel shit imagining a scenario where a woman who is so far out of your league is interested in you so that you can reject her to feel good about yourselfmadbut the conversation was about the people who walk past their cheating partner to pick a fight with the other persondude i can make up scenarios where cheating is murky to anyone on the outside and how its best not to get involved getting involved is not the standard you should be very very careful before you get involved in other people relationshipslmao this comment amounts to youre wrong because i am very smart actuallythats not an argument my dude youve established nothing and proved nothingif you think the church is cool with people cheating on their sos as long as they arent technically married idk what to tell you other than you clearly dont know church doctrine as well as you think',\n",

also be hurt cant wait for his games of excellence as we glide to a solid th place finishzaccharie risacher he closed the season playing really well and the hawks will likely be much better this year i would think trae is a lock at this pointyou have a lot more faith in voters than i dobilalfranz and especially jalen johnson wouldnt be surprises imoprobably someone on the heat herro made it after all id think bam should get in this timemikal plsim surprised no one is saying brandon millerthe biggest surprise is most likely that gradey guy in toronto cade cunninghamfranz wagner or norman powelljarrett allen potentially he hasnt made it since but his stats have been just as good and the team is betterit wont surprise me but i feel lile ben mathurin getting in is not on everyones listmathurin or nembhard both have the figurative keys to the pacers i could see them making an appearancepaolo bancheroivey jalen johnson siakam franz wagner and my pipe dream nikola jokic oh daniels tooalex starr is beefed up and has been blocking everything he could sneak inthey are not doing east west allstars this year its way too lopsidedoh hell yeahmagic with all stars would be magicalthats not a surprisehes already averaging ppg rebs assists and magic is built for himsubscribei wouldnt call that a surprise i had him as an allstar this year even tho he didnt make itjalen johnsonwe are all hopingandrew nembhardtj mcconnellknicks with brunson and kat and cavs with mitchell and garlandmobley is guaranteed to have at least allstars in next years east unless an injury happen to theman an australian id be stoked if dyson gets voted as an all star him and giddey are my favourite aussies currently in the leaguepaulo franz cade ivey if both teams are top seedsthats not a surprise though we all know ingram can score its just a matter of if it translates well with the raptors and theyre actually winningjalen johnsoni appreciate you calling brunson a lock and cade a might do it again guy and then giving cade the start instead anywaycade is more of a lock than brown imoif mobley isnt a no doubter allstar theres a huge problem in clevelandthink hell be on the bulls for opening tipthen the bulls will overpay himare those really surprises thoughlet him roamits his best chanceplease lordsubscribeif turner is an allstar and no pacers make it i would literally ascend on the spotwhy do the media members hate him so muchivey is more likely if he builds on last years production i dont see the offensive game from ausar being there yeti would take embiid out of that the man will probably be injured just before the all star breakorlando too or detroit or atlantafeels like bam will have a bounce back season as hes been a popular coaches pick in previous all star reserves ballotsthink michael porter jr may prevent that but either one can go for on any given night if they have the greenlightthats not randomsecondnah hes the lebron james of cj mccollums for never making an all star teamyeah this i think with haliburton out those two have a opportunity to take a bigger rolelmao maybe in your dreamsi appreciate the support but how would that be a surprisenikola jokic would be a surprise east all star probably the biggest out of all those guyswasnt he injured in january had to miss the rest of the seasonim excited to see what he does with a consistent role as a primary playmaker dude was absolutely cooking in the series against boston last yeari was looking through the teams and nembhard absolutely could earn a spoti could totally see it hes shown so many flashes his stats will be really inflated now that hes the lead ball handlerwrong pacer that starts with neyeah i think brunson has a high floor for what he could do this season whereas cade has the lower floor but higher ceiling i can see a world where the pistons are disappointing this year and cade underperforms but there is also a more likely world where the pistons are a top seed in the east and cade is nearing the mvp conversationwe kind of know what the knicks will be probably a win team with jalen brunson and towns as their leadersbrunson also plays in new york so he has that advantage for the fan votingjaylens numbers should only get better without tatum hes been an allstar each of the last seasons of the last and has the benefit of playing in boston which gets a lot of respect from both the fanvoting and the media unless boston is a win team or worse the celtics will have one allstar and almost certainly that guy will be jaylen browncades only been an allstar one year and while i dont think its the case at all there is a higher chance of a fluke with one year for cade and the pistons than years of jaylen brown and detroit doesnt get the same mediafanvote lovebi being healthy enough to make it would be quite surprisingif he goes hes probably in thereteam doesnt win he doesnt play defense hes very inefficient and chooses to make highlights over playing actual basketball that contributes to winning games he also is out for most of the year every year hes only played seasons worth of games the last seasonshis playstyle works on the hornets but its closer to a hassan whiteside situation focusing on putting up numbers over actually working on improving his game he takes more shots than ever rebounds less still cant defend or be healthy actually averages less assists with a better roster and is even less efficientbecause the allstar reserves for the east were garland cade mobley jaylen brown siakam dame and herro who were all just having better seasonshes a good player but his game is mostly style and little substance he has to prove his style can result in winning and until he does hes a good stats bad team type player those guys rarely make allstar teamsthink its just residuals from his dad and the path he took playing pro overseas vs collegei dont see it for detroit atleast not yet if orlando and atlanta dont have something seriously went wrongmpj will be injured imooh my bad i didnt know he was an all star thats impressive for himmy pick for a first time all star then will be jalen johnsonit would be a surprise for fans outside orlando to pay attention to orlando even though theyll make the eastern finals this year orlando vs san antonio in the finals in yearsend of january but likely wasnt goimg to make it bc of hawks record this year i feel theyll be much higher in the standings come voting timebut the east is so ass that detroit looks like a lock for a top seedits closer to a hassan whiteside situation focusing on putting up numbers over actually working on improving his gamei really dont think is accurate you really should look at the people hes playing with most of the time because i can tell you its very often third stringers and sometimes even th stringers if you look at any season be had real teammates for he is very unselfish his all star year miles bridges was the teams leader scorer by ppg but still and that was because lamelo was feeding him so much worth noting that he also got off the ball enough for rozier to average ppg they each averaged and hes been working on his weaknesses his defense has clearly improved last year he worked with actual nba refs in the off season to learn how to draw fouls when drivinghis issue is health his playstyle does need to change a bit probably less off the dribble threes and more drives but the narrative about him not caring is so played up actually averages less assists with a better rosterthe roster was better but all of the good players were hurt so the rotation was worse tre mann brandon miller and grant williams all had season ending injuries long before the all star break and mark williams couldnt stay healthy in general a solid peppering of consistent minor injuries to everyone else too all of kj simpson damion baugh tidjane salaun and taj gibson started at some point this year all this plus the fact he played injury admittedly not smart from the org to let him its actually impressive he still averaged ivey could easily come back and be a point scorer or duren could be a guyif the team has a good record i could see itpaolo has already been an all star and wouldve been one last year if not for injury im pretty sure the general public at least knows hes all star leveli wouldnt assume the general public knows their ass from a hole in the ground but then again i grew up a magic fan and havent forgiven the world at large for never voting in nick anderson',\n",
       " 'zubacs career year last season had a lot to do with hardeni mean look at all the dudes who have succeeded as individuals next to him who wouldnt want to play with thatgreat leader not leasejames harden has transformed himself from a heliocentric guard to a more traditional table setterin line with nash cp so not that surprising one of the more interesting nerdy things to comment on is just how many modern guards take after harden over say curry like look at nembhard super low dribble iso step back in the finals lolso much hate in the media for harden but of course players respect him when he was averaging a game on them and jacking stepback s in their face for yearsharden has giving multiple player career years hes of the best playmakers evereveryone thats played with him have career years and get paid id want to tooyou mean a guy whos been atop the assist leader charts ever since he saw major time with the ball is someone that can get other guys shots mud takedont say this on rnbatalkim not a harden or clipper guy but this isnt surprising guy is one of the best passers everthe west is a bloodbath denver could have beaten okc if they hadnt lost mpjs shoulder and ags hamstringand the clips took them to tooboth teams have improved this off season so im expecting these guys to be competitive in the playoffsmost guys have career years with harden from bums to stars all want him game is easy with himharden has always been a great player its just the free throw merchant days that makes people hate him but its the same thing as how people are reacting to sga now its not because theyre not skilled but they took advantage of the system its not wrong at all its an effective way of winning everyone wants to win the second thing that people criticise him for was his playoff performance the whistles didnt translate to the playoffs and that is why he struggles other than those points i dont see how people dont think of harden as a great player hes not that bad as a defender as people make it out to be hes great at post defending because he was strong its similar to luka but they always seem to end up guarding the guards and just straight up get out speed by other guards at this point in his career with how people tries to compare him to wade i dont even look at him as a shooting guard anymore hes more of a point guard steph curry is more of an sg compared to hardenjames hooks everyone up with the groupon to the clubis this news harden continues to elevate guys year in and year out and beal knows its his last chance to land his final contract so its a perfect match for everyonetil nba players know more about ball than redditorsharden one of the most if not the most underappreciated superstars by the media and fansharden is a great playmaker and gets other people openharden is a legitimately great distributorinteresting that i havent really heard anything about the cp reunion considering how terrible it supposedly was at the end of their partnership in houstonreally wish the rockets couldve given him a star teammate that wasnt a pgthere was a period where he routinely showed up out of shape and didnt try on defense but last year changed that narrative a lot even if hes no longer as efficient as he once wasthats crazy yet some dumbass casuals will stay say harden is a bad teammate or locker room cancerwhen he has had mujltiple teammates in the past talk about him as a great teammategonna be a fun team to watch for better or worsehe can also get you into any club no questions askedpressure he meant party withnba players always spoke respectfully of harden then hating ass fans prime harden was one of the greatest scorers in history nhr wasnt an elite athlete but had an amazing first step and incredible feetwork and handles he was a certified bucket and dantoni really helped him expand his playmaking capabilitiesharden gets shit on a lot but hes one of the greatest offensive players ever he works his ass off sure there are plenty of negatives but its as if most nephews have never seen prime hardenpeople see the playmaking and think yes i can work with thathe was always good at that but he became something quite a bit more than good as a tablesetter during his time in houstoni think some people have confused being a potential headache for coaches and management with being bad to play with or a bad teammate for a while the perception other players have of their peers is very different to what we see and hear as fansembiid credited harden for helping him win mvp when kd was being traded from the nets he had philly on his list of preferred teams because he loves playing with harden when harden hit his first game winner as a clipper it was kawhi who was the most excited guy on the court zubat last season took the leap to the next level partially because of harden players love playing with hardeni mean why wouldnt you want to harden is one of those dudes who just makes the people around him better he also i just raises the floor of your team a ton who wouldnt want to play with one of the absolute best playmakersfacilitators in the league no surprise someone like zubacs has gone to a complete different level with harden on the teamelite passers always gets players paid look at all the dudes harden got paid through his career especially bigs he even made christian wood looked amazing in those few games they had togetheri bet harden is a solid hang at after party spots toodeletedokd wade just be talkinthen why was he picked last in the nba all star game draft one of lifes biggest mysteriesi also hear beals wife wants to play with james hardenif u know u knowsimilar reason as to why capela was so effective on the rocketsmaxey will likely still raise to stardom but its pretty clear the speed in which he did had something to do w hardenfacts norm tooembiid won mvp with harden guy is a generational playmaker and doesnt get enough credit for being an otherworldly scorer in his prime and now being top best passer in the gamei feel pure point guard play is so underrated in this league guys like joker luka haliburton yang harden elevate their teammatesjames did but zubac for the first time in his career got in shape dude avg more minutes a game last season he used to be gassed at min a game props to zu for finally putting the snacks downzu went from catching shitty bailout passes from westbrook pg pat bev reggie jackson to being the focal point of offense in james hardenhes such an ultimate pick and roll partner because hes lethal as both a passer and a shooter forces defenses to pick their poison either way which means his bigs get a lot of lobs and the shooters around him get a ton of open shotstbf zubacs best point guard before harden was patbevthat rapist ben mclemore got a couple of extra seasons in the league because harden made him look serviceableask daryl morey how trying to lease james harden in philly wentnever understood why reddit gives you shot at post titles and after that youre fuckedpremium lease with beard included at no extra chargeoh i was sure you meant teaselol here i am thinking shit i dont know that slang im old and imagining what it means through context and nodding my head like i guess i get it spell check out here making new slang for us oldsi didnt even blink at that lol with the stories of players renting each others houses after switching teamsdeletedhas more to do with what harden said steph dont count he has god given talent that cant be replicated you can still imitate harden he isnt like an otherworldly shootermy pet theory is that the modern meta is closer to the rockets than the warriorsthe warriors were about how to get the most out of drafting all time great shooters in curry and thompson the rockets were about how to get the most out of role playersi disagree with this narrative that harden has transformed into a pass first guard when it comes to on court playstyle this is who harden has always been even when dropping bombs with the rockets every other day people who actually watched him play instead of highlights have known harden to be a playmaker he wasnt scoring so much because thats what he wanted to do as much as it was out of necessity and knowing hes capable of it look at his rockets teams back then and tell me who wouldve taken up the scoring load if he wasnt carrying it all by himself he was always a willing passer just didnt have someone to pass it to most of the time harden is a severely underrated offensive genius people just recognize his scoring and passing now in his later years but hes been an all time great in generating offense and breaking down defenses regardless of who ends up scoring of the major things that herro improved on this season is taking currys shot diet and adding hardens low rip thru moveguys wanted to play with him even when he was the heliocentric guardhe didnt transform himself he always had that playmaking skill he just does it more relative to how much he scoresharden is a more realistic goal that you can accomplish not easy and is probably better for players to follow in the long run currys shooting so ungodly that trying to match that is just unrealistic and would get you booted off many teamsi dunno theres plenty of stephlike players too its more just based on player characteristics haliburton and trae would be examples obviously everyone good does the stepback cause its such a powerful move doesnt automatically make someone a harden cloneplayers realized its much harder to replicate currycurry is not just the point god hes also the cardio god currys cardio is just godly players are gassed just trying to chase curry aroundhe had to do that as he couldnt stay in shapei mean tbf most of the hate is related to his playoff performances hes always been an iron man who people like to play with especially later in his career hes still one of the best players everya man no one hates harden because hes talented the hate came from the absolutely egregious floppingi kinda think manu and harden were very similar players in the playoffs the difference is manu was used incorrectly during the regular season so when he was unleashed in the playoffs everyone was super impressed while harden was used perfectly during the regular season and when he got adjusted to in the playoffs people were super criticalhe was actually averaging and then lol had runs when hed average a game for months he was otherworldly those couple of years insane that they gave giannis mvp over himyeah in the regular seasoneven better just dont go to rnbatalkthat hatred has just spilled over to things irrelevant to harden as a player he gets a lot of hate from his exit out of houston and brooklyn even though both are reasonable things to do when your workplace is going up in flames even his exit from philly gets hated on but the dude carries them two games and couldnt push embid over the hill that yearthats why philly okc didnt work out he needs to be in a tier us city for clubs bottle servicemaster of logistics along the rhinetbf its still summer i think well hear more of it as they enter the regular season with all the guys backyou mean someone like dwight howardyour team employed count brickula for yearsweirdoin out of the seasons beal reached the playoffs he averaged more ppg in the playoffs than he did in the regular season his ts drops from percentage points but thats not uncommon for example kds drops percentage points and currys drops percentage pointsfor a guy thats primarily a scorer his numbers do not indicate him as a playoff dropperhes just practicingstfupj tucker added four more years to his career because of hardendont let hawks fans hear thatcapela going to atlanta and relatively dropping off the face of the earth shows how much of an impact harden haszu was great before harden but harden got him to a good place in the pick and roll gamepraying that my lord and savior spo can have a similar effectinserting yang in that list pg had his best stats in years with harden feeding him open looks goes to the sixers and look what happenedharden is going to go down as one of the best offensive players in nba history to not win a titlehistory will remember him as a better version of steve nash he has a ton of hardware all nba teams mvp all starhe gets plenty of creditharden changed how maxey plays and maxey credited harden with his skills tightening uptrae young erasureis there a single player who left houston during hardens tenure and peaked here that didnt fall off a cliff after its actually absurd the amount of players who looked good in houston next to him parsons capela ariza tucker gordon dwight roco fucking sam decker looked promising herei remember bill simmons saying mclemore could be the next dwade before he got drafted thats definitely not where my mind went to right away but your also not wrongdaryl morey is a liari dont believe that mankevin mchale couldnt run an offensemchale sucks at coachingi wonder what you think about all those down votes for you dumb commentshooting plays a huge role obviously but i think lots of guards dont want to play as off ball like curry lolhardens definitely one of the best shooters ever maybe hes not otherworldly in the traditional sense of catch and shoot efficiency but almost no one ever can consistently hit multiple stepback contested s a gamestill love that quote it was so gd genuine when the guys asked him and his responselike nah im first lmao he dont count and you could really see he was joking but at the same time wasntharden is still one of the best shooters ever it just takes a wild amount of conditioning to be steph and sprint around all gameits also just easier to teach on ball skills than off ball skills which is a huge part of stephs gamethats part of it i guess sure but also being curry is just way more annoying to do and harder to fit on most teams you need to condition like a marathon runner and then have a non point gaurd playmaker who can find you on all your cuts the shooting isnt even the hardest part harden still has one of the best accelerationdeacceleration talent ever thoughtheres a reason in school the kids imitate curry but all the coaches teach you how to play like hardencurry doesnt have god given talent lol he just has a crazy work ethic and is obsessed with being a great shooter his game was all through hard work and dedication my pet theory is that the modern meta is closer to the rockets than the warriorsthat should not be considered a pet theorythe warriors have a very unique formula in dray and curry that is hard to copy the rockets have always been a more replicable modelrockets are more replicable but warriors offence is better if you have the personnel for itthe warriors system needs intelligent players who can read and react to what the defense is giving them its why draymondsteph pickroll can be a devastating weapon because of the additional motion around themdraymond has the iq to pick apart defenses and find the open man while the opposition is scrambling to keep a man on steph because they are absolutely terrified of the greatest pt shooter ever we already say how the warriors system starts to fall apart when the ball ends up in the hands of players who simply cannot read a defense quick enough see kelly oubre messing up the steph relocation a staple of the warriors offense because he doesnt even know what he is looking for irrational confidence in his own shoti dont think a heliocentric guard is devoid of playmaking quite the opposite they are the main creators and see high usage time of dribblepossesion and assist numberssee luka trae rockets harden just that they are different than more traditonal pgs like cpnashkiddthere were so many games where harden couldve gone for pts in houston but he just chose to pass or sat early many pure scorers wouldve gone for the records but harden will never do that hes always looking for the passing lanes he only had that outrageous season in houston because he felt like his teammates couldnt score efficiently enough and even then he still averaged nearly assists that seasontrae is more like harden than he is like steph haliburton isnt like steph either dont know where that comes fromare you forgetting when harden was left off allnbathen you need to hate on all the top scorersharden was cheesing the game hard at some point it felt like he got caught up playing spreadsheet ball instead of adjustingdeveloping his playoff gameim guessing a lot of fans here missed the harden armhooking and foul baiting erai dont think id blame harden for his exit out of rocket and nets he went ring chasing but get fucked by covid and kyrie drama he would have won that year sixers wasnt even his fault as well he was promised one thing and got the other hes a superstar not a role player of course he would be mad even wade got pissed off and left for bullsbut harden has always been like that in the playoffs and thats why theres a saying that says you either get james harden or just james in the playoffsand then ur team decided to trade sts and swaps for him lolcount brickula i havent heard that one before missed and traded for brick guynah lolmad i talked about your daddy like thateverything capela learned from harden in the pnr was taught to trae by capela so thank you to james harden for giving the blueprint to making him usefulwhy lolhe dropped off the face of the earth because hes a athletic rim runner who got old and injured capela was the nd best player on an ecf team and wouldve been st team all defense if it was positionlesscapela was sick for the hawks before his body failed him nd best player on the ecf team with the traeclint pick and roll being a huge feature in the offensepeople really just talk out of their ass here lol capela was arguably the nd most impactful hawk in their ecf runharden made fcking kenneth fried look like an all starhis stats are comparative at first he got older and is injury prone he was great in atlanta immediately following the rockets stint youre just making shit up lmaobrother what capela went to the ecf with trae and was a top dpoy contender and led the league with boards it was arguably capelas best year both harden and trae helped capelaand imo capela helped trae because he was just an elite screenerpnr partner after playing with harden so long also i dont think we can attribute capelas defensive impact or elite rebounding to either harden or traethe swiss just arent that effective without the nazi next doorcompletely agree harden unlocked zu as an elite rim runnertucker obviously had his best years in houston but he was still pretty important in the bucks championship rundaniel house gerald green and mbah a moute too ariza and roco had pretty solid careers overall especially arizacapela was good for atlanta for a few years afterimo the mavs offer to parsons was always an overpay but the main reason it turned into such a disaster was injuriesryan anderson tooasik motiejunas fucking terrance jonesyourelet me say that againfr tho what has morey done without harden hes considered a good gm bc its easy to build around harden hardens probably the second best floor raiser of all time behind lebronand a card cheatmorey is a dumbass and singlehandedly ruined embiids prime by burning bridges with harden then waiting a year to get pg only to have it immediately be the worst contract in the league as soon as he signed ityet sixers fans give him a pass and still to this day blame that whole thing on harden harden is the only reason embiid has an mvppretty god awful gm too unless you like sending things to the celtics for cheapi dont think ppl have the enduranceyou got to remember its a lot easier for a kid to practice on ball day in day on their own then it is to practice playing off ball that requires at least one person to pass you the rockno one else in the league has the cardio to do it like stephis it that they dont want to or that they cant steph gets so much credit for being the goat shooter but his off ball movement is also insane and a huge part of his success dont want to play as off ball like curry lolyes because they dont want to do whats hard there is a reaosn curry career has lapped hardenyeah im def downplaying him a bit i already have my handle as his name cant glaze too brazenlydeadass ppl forget curry led the league in scoring and ts what the fits a good quote but its bullshit lol does anyone harden included honestly believe hes not also unbelievably naturally talented to a degree that almost nobody else can really match regardless of effort i get that quote is him saying it about the one guy he feels that way about but literally everyone else feels that way about harden loloh yeah hes top something for sure but idk if id say hes the second best behind steph so clearly not in a league of his own maybe as a purse isolation three point shooter hes in his own league though but so much of that is predicated on his counters i feel likeyeah takes the right attitude endurance and game feel to be super crazy off ball lots of guards probably just want to spam pnr or isosman when you your dad and brother all shot from three in an nba season on volume that means you got insane genetics as a baselineyeah not many teams run a motion offense they choose instead to go for rockets esque pnr and drive and kickssee bostonare all teams that have a clear point guard heliocentric are the pacers heliocentric with hali are the nuggets with jokicgenuine question is heliocentricity determined by usage touches of points or something elsepretending that harden isnt a hall of fame flopper is sillyall top scorers foul bait they do not do what harden was doing during his peak with flopping stop pretending its the same lmaonothing more than stars get all the time look at sga this yearnah we just dont care dont hate the player hate the gamerefshaha got emmmdoesnt really invalidate the point one error doesnt clear another the extent to which either is an error is not for me to decideand rockets fans universally agree that trading for brick man was the worst move in our franchise historylakers agree btwyeah idk lol trae was the perfect pairing for him tooand we should be talking about how good both harden and trae are as playmakers not one vs the other both are amazinghim and trae had the most assists that year and he also lead the league in rebounds that year toohow dare did you forgor kvon like that kenneth faried looked like a perennial allstar playing next to harden it was incredible but as soon as he got off the team he was immediately out of the league at a young age tooi remember that interview with zu when harden first got there harden would have the bigs on the team to do just pr after every practice and zu was saying how incredible of a passer he wasyeah they had good careers but went from being top tier role players here to completely irrelevanti mean after we squandered years of tmac and yao it took morey years to build that team that took the lakers to with yao and tmac both hurt lowry brooks scola artest and carl landry while keeping guys like battier and chuck hayesif we got morey earlier before yaotmac died we probably could have made a run we had guys score in a playoff game one of the few years they were both healthy just wasted them with awful supporting casts counting on guys like luther headcp is definitely up thereover curryand if they are going to be timed at the end of the game they rather be tired being on ball and being able to call their own show over running around off ball and sometimes not getting the ball on time or on target or at allthey also dont didnt have a top shooter alltime next to them klay the greatest defender of this era draymond who also is a hell of a playmaker and floor general a system designed to have players agree to set multiple offball screens for steph generational role players iggy livingston bogut and an elite organization that did their best to keep the core togetherfox in definitely had the cardio but he did not have the same shootingscoring abilityusually players that have a great scoring ability to steph no one can shoot like steph do so by getting stronger and beef up a little think brunsonharden to get to their spots on ball steph stays lean because he is a bigger threat getting spacespots off ball like reggie miller but has the handlescoringpassing versatility to also be a major on ball threattheres no one who fits that mold well and even if they might its unlikely they have a team running their big as the pg who can pass like draymond so by design for most high scoring guards its best the ball be in their hands and not run them off ballyou need the cardio and goat shooting ability to play like stephwhydude also sees another high performing athlete and realizes the gap even though he is clearly in the top or of pointers hes literally pointers made behindi think it shows a based man lmao people think athletes are all like bred one way trust me they are not even while being ultra competitivei think that based on his difficulty of shot attempts and his sheer volume on above average efficiency i have to have him as like a top shooter everid say heliocentric is a mixture of fga usage time spent dribbling the ball and assists most traditional table setter pgsnash cp haliburton have usage rates that hover around low to mid while rockets harden was could go up to in also not tracked as well as other stats but heliocentric guards usually dribble a lothave high time of possesionsee brunson rockets harden luka and dont move off ball muchits that stuff that seperates a table setter from a helio guard imohe is just like the other top scorers in the leagueluka and sga literally are doing the same thing and embiid might be the worst with his antics and falling down for no reasonand sga gets backlash for itexcept for embiid ehim not really countering the point lol more pointing out how funny it is that the rockets did thatonly to be usurped by trading for durantyoull seethey lead the lead is assists multiple years and we had just as much success as the rockets did lmao capela lost a lot of athleticism and is injury prone now we was great in atlanta thoabsolutelyi forgorthats true i didnt think abt how frustrating running and not getting rock isscorer vs shooter debate tbhhis contemporaries that have echando to catch him for sake of argument are dame and klay dame is pointers behind him klay is the young guys to challenge him is mainly mitchell rn who has half as much as him and aint young any moreso harden didnt really transform himself into a traditional pg then since he still does all of the things a heliocentric guard doesso just to be clear you sincerely believe that every top player exaggerates andor flops the exact same amount as every other top player and its impossible for them to do so in different amounts or do you think they had a meeting where they all agreed on the amount of flopping they would do so that nobody would be doing more or lessand people talk shit about all of them for it theyll all be remembered for iti hate them both tooharden was literally jumping on top of guys backs but of course with that flair you love him embiid might be the worst with his antics and falling down for no reasoni agree that all top scorers foul bait but in his prime harden was just as bad as embiid definitely worse than luka and sga harden had some egregious flops and baitsyup and i got a bunch of downvotes for bringing it up lolah that it is he did used to make it worka huge amount of his scoring was based around the three ai dont think its a super popular opinion but i do think hes a tier shooter all timei absolutely think hes in that same tier as klay and dame as a shooter i think youre splitting hairs to separate those guyswow what a smart responsejokic just pulled that move in last years playoffs better put him up there in the hall of flopping fameyou also cant forget that the league took out some foul baits few years ago like jumping into the defender or hooking your arm into the defender on a drivethis thread is clearly full of people too young to remember this when theyre saying he never did anything sga and luka dont do i love harden but he was nigh unwatchable for a while there half of every shot was a hook attemptthank youto give the league credit though they cracked down on that shit pretty hard before the rise of luka sga they started calling a lot of stuff harden did as offensive fouls and players stopped doing it',\n",

challenging for that to happen when you hit on more than homegrownsi dont know what the market correction is that would keep star players on the same team for their entire career while getting fairly compensated but this second apron and previous cba changes came from the league wanting to correct other undesirable playerteam behaviors star free agents big spending teams with mixed results so whos to say the adjustment will have the intended impactthe call is coming from inside the housethis new cba can promote fo and fans alike rooting against their guys winning awards lolwere all trying to find the guy who did thiswell then maybe you shouldnt have agreed to this awful new cba theni do want to say for the guys who like really think cj did it remember hes just like the head player rep they had to sign off on it but all of the actual work is handled by lawyers so really they need better lawyers lolthey can retain chet and jdub theyll have to offload other players to do it but they can keep them whats the problemthe problem is there is so much talent now and even if you just draft decently you have to pay up or lose them to another team the parity of the league partly comes from how talented the young dudes are nowadays so no drafting well shouldnt be protected from the aprons and capsits funny that people keep using this line as an attack because i have yet to see a team actually punished for drafting well by the current cba were the suns punished for drafting well is that why they were in second apron hell when the celtics gave huge contracts to kristaps and jrue and decided to cut bait earlier than expected due to tatums injury was that punishment for drafting well when the nuggets overpaid two often injured players in mpj and murray was that a punishment for drafting well the cba is designed to disperse talent and improve parity that has undeniably happened and having a super team with super max caliber players is going to make team construction difficult but no one has actually been a victim of the cba in this way teams that mortgage their future in pursuit of small championship windows have absolutely been punished but no team that thoughtfully manages their cap or drafts well has beenmy brother in christ you negotiated the cba that punishes teams for drafting welli dont get his point all of the champions in last decades built around the player they drafted other thank lakers whats he trying to sayand wasnt he the player rep that negotiated the last contract its a union people all the players voted for thisit is all on you stephon urkelcj fucked up to be sure but lets stop acting like its him and silver sitting at a table hashing out the cbai love rnbas conception of cba negotiation as like a dark souls boss fight mccollum battling it out alone against nba ownership and associated legal reps solely responsible for all positive and negative outcomes that resultits a union its a collective bargaining agreement and its a two way street players ask for things owners ask for things eventually a compromise that favors the owners is reached and we have an agreement weirdly no one treats ownership this way where are all the lmao clay bennett did this to himself comments when people complain that the thunder cant afford to pay their playersi really dont get the narrative of this is punishing you if you draft well teams that draft well are still at a major advantage over those that dont but not letting one team have all stars in max contracts makes the league more competitive and makes it less feast or faminking von saying end the violence jeffery epstein saying i hate pedophilesguys the owners put the aprons in place to essentially create a hard cap they didnt want golden state paying mil per year in tax to assemble shooter voltron because it meant that they would also have to pay that much to be competitive and the players would make way more money why the fuck would the players ask for essentially a hard capdevils advocate not looking for downvotes here but is this another reward for tanking you dont draft well without significant losing wemby could benefit from this sentiment the most just for not playing and the spurs for losingthis guy stinksno we should keep giving teams like the lakers with years of mediocre fo decisions all of our superstars youre not thinking of the ratings cjbut if you draft well then youre not being punished you keep getting great players who can fill in the holes youre going to have after you dont sign someone to a contract you cant afford chet was great for okc but is he actually worth a max contract sga should be getting a max contract on that team and everyone else should be getting paid very well but certainly not a maxif only he had the power to do something about itoh waitall this to stop the warriorsokc isnt being punished for drafting well theyre about to be punished for overpaying their guysdoes drafting well mean getting the pick in a rigged lotterya smart guy who deserves to be the president of the nbapathere should be exemptions on the aprons if youre resigning a player you acquired through draft whether it was a draft day trade or pickthe apron should only kick in when signing or trading for players who previously played for other teams regardless of theyre all star all nba or plain role playerslegitimately it sucks that teams dont exist anymore how am i supposed to get attached to a team when every years of the roster is gone or traded nobody can afford anyone and prices have gotten too high honestly if i was the nba id cut pay to the top earners and if they dont like it im sure players below them will take the money no problemis he not the one who negotiated this the lack of self awareness amongst nba players is concerningid implore everybody to actually watchlisten to this episode rather than just rage the bait with this clip its a good cast of characters and really interesting listen cj does not have as much power and influence as a lot of users here give him credit forwish he was in a position to negotiate that type of decisioncj you negotiate this awful cba whille your making mil this year your peers who arent super stars are forced to make less than ever before you kill the role player salaries in favor of rookies and killed free agencybro is about to be cast in both roles of the next dumb and dumber moviethis dudes head does not fit his bodyits a simple fix players you drafted have a lesser cap hit on the apronshe should probably go be the head of the players association to get this kind of thing sorted outall you have to do is make it so that only of the salary counts against the cap if they are still on the team that drafted them there ya go simplewhy is this allowed to be posted twiceidk winning through the draft and tanking is stronger than its ever been with no free agency stars there is a reason vet teams are struggling to make contenders just look at the buckswith no star fas to add pieces you gotta trade all your picks just to get somebody and if it doesnt work out welp too bad the tanking team still has all your picks regardless so just stay mediocre and you cant even blow it up cause you have no picks i think this is the real problem with the nba atmthats the price of greatness lol the best layers should make the mosthe looks like jaleel white lolwere all trying to find the guy that did this vibesplayers union needs to hire people who are smarter than nba players to negotiate on their behalfand you shouldnt be rewarded for tanking or for your team playing poorly but here we arenegotiated this shit to kill the warriors dynasty and any future dynasty thought he was gonna win one in their absence realizing father time is here he sucks his team sucks hell never win one and is back pedaling nowdo you want okc to challenge the s celtics while the other teams compete for nd place for the next decadebecause this cba is saving you from that no one but sam presti wants that and even sam knows it is bad for the leagueever since i heard this motherfucker chewing on a podcast smackin his lips and shit i really dislike him its irrationalhe acting like he didnt sign it off setting aside the fact that cj had a seat at the negotiating table this is just a dishonest way to frame it the thunder arent being punished for drafting well they just cant go out and sign trade for a bunch of great players that other teams drafted while paying max salaries but nothing in the cba can stop them from drafting a new stud every single season that improves on the sga jdub chet core at that point its entirely up to them how much money they want to spend keeping their pickswell you didnt do that my guynew cba should reward teams drafting well like player drafted doesnt count against the cap or draft players are only half the cap hitisnt this by design to increase parity this is exactly what happens in the nfl and why the championship window is shorterso we expect a change in that players that played the rookie season with the team would give a small discount in the cap thats my guessthe call is coming from within the house dear heart the players association guy trying to deny his unions agency in the negotiations is an interesting onei hate shooting from mid range and especially free throwsshaithanks cjthis is like capitalism vs socialism debate one saying if we are savvy enough to draft and trade well we should be able to keep all of it another is saying no no if you do too well we have laws to take some of that away from you so there is a little more for people that were unlucky or unfortunate nobody asked to politicize this matter but here it is you want parity or dynasty hard to do bothwe are all looking for the guy who did thispaying a player you drafted a max contract should come with a of said contract waiver to the salary cap that waiver is then null and void if the player is then traded this helps the team that drafts well keep their players but also disincentives sign and tradesi mean cj youre the one who agreed to this cba cj mccollum were all looking for who did thisin his defense it may be the case that he knew all this when the pa agreed to the cba and hethe other players thought that it would be worse to have a lockout than to agree to these terms and keep negotiating for the next cba thats a totally defensible positionthe thing is i used to believe this but at the same time teams shouldnt be allowed to just max every player so that theres no risk of them leaving player movement has always been a key to the nbawell cj no one wants to see a fucking dynasty lmaocjs job in these negotiations is to maximize return for the players all the dont punish the teams for drafting well business should be the owners responsibility and yet fingers only ever get pointed at the players association for these unwanted impacts of the second apron etc why does the players association get all the blame in this what am i missingpreachto all the morons who are blaming cj mccollum for the new cba do you not understand how negotiations work cj or more likely the actual lawyers and negotiators who represented the nbpa could have been saying this in the room but if the other side the owners didnt budge on it then the players either accept it give something else up in exchange for it or go on strike its not like all cj had to do was say so and it would have been fixedwho has been hurt for drafting wellbruhon one hand it sounds pretty ideal that you can have a home grown team with minimal worry that youll have to chop it up if its too successful but on the other wouldnt this just shift talent inequality from players to gms and scouting teams youll have a handful of super teams railroading through everyone else because they have a gm who is particularly skilled at drafting well which is rare to do consistently the idea between capping teams even on players they draft is to enhance parity it isnt perfect and has some drawbacks but i think it works much better than a setup that says youre team is probably going to only be as good as your gm is at scouting talentso just further pushing teams to tank and stack picks so they can end up like the thunder rockets and othersdid the nbapa not read the cba before voting for itthis is so fucking funny nba really has the best comedic timing sometimesthere should be a second apron relief if the player was drafted by the teamhe was the head of the players association when the cba was signed if he wants to blame anyone for the unintended consequences he should just look in the mirrorim not educated enough on the complexity of nba financials but it seems to me to be two separate core issues player salary and team taxes players should always get their market value and teams shouldnt be penalized for retaining drafted talentprobably more complicated than this but super max deals for drafted talent shouldnt count towards of the team tax apron find whatever works to prevent super teams through free agency but it would be nice to see more players be financially and competitively rewarded by staying with a team long termthe nba needs a hard cap and hard floor eliminate the apron and luxury taxhow to win with the new cba tank for draft picks draft well pay for talented vets and put them on years contracts you can even overpay for them since youre underpaying every where else rockets find success pay the young players dump the vets trade the stars for picks and rebuild when you dont winyou arent though you just gotta keep drafting welli mean if a team is willing to overpay for a player another team drafted they why shouldnt they this has been going on even before the new cba role players who won championships with the heatlesspurswarriorslebron got lucrative offers from other teams the team that loses those players found creative ways to fill the roster holes all this new cba does is prevent a team from forming superteams warriors with durant the nba is far more enjoyable when we have parity its why we have the pacers in the finals which was a super fun cinderella runfuck you cj this is your faulta question i have from this so you arent punished for drafting good will this create more dynasties like there have always been minus recently and the s especially pre when it was easier for teams to retain their players whether good or bad im not sure just an observationquestionignoring the fact that cj helped create this new cba how does anyone propose doing that while still having competitive balance in the leaguelook were all trying to find out who did thisif youre that good at drafting youll do it consistently if youre not doing it consistently it means you probably guessed when you did it which is the truth of the time in the nbawasnt he a big part of the players union as the cba was being sculptedall these cba rules are dancing around the obvious issue nba salaries are top heavy and overinflated players like beal are a prime example of terrible contracts that the nba circle has found a way to justify how often do players need to fleece x team or y gm before we go wow theyre all overpaid hell think about the contract schroeder turned down he wouldve made mil and precisely for what the whole league is paid based on potential not on actual successyou shouldnt have your house blown down big bad wolflakers in shamblescouldnt agree more you should be able to afford the players that you draftedi think the league and owners specifically want to prevent another gswi have no idea if this would be a good idea or not but what if the nba did something like a player a team drafts and pays gets a cap discount maybe exempt supermax ideki agree with this contracts for players you drafted shouldnt count towards the capthe problem is b tier players making the max because teams are afraid to lose them you get stuck with a insert player you think is good but wouldnt want as a number option as a anchor on the cap that extra million a year cost the team a valuable role player or lose a starter that you can no longer affordcj is the andre memeits your fault bitchthey should start a players union maybe one that has one of the players as a figurehead to make sure these smart veteran insights are presented during cba talks cj seems smart he could be an optionyou made the sandwichwhat is best for the league isnt always what is best for the playerswouldnt this also only further incentive tanking not only do you get the best players but now their contracts count less towards your cap because you drafted themthis actually makes sense if a team drafts a player that player on that team should be except from the luxury tax cap it would force teams to draft for championships and not strictly revenues it would force players to stay loyal to a franchise if they want to win a championship it would make the league so much more competitive less super teams and super marketsnba needs a franchise tag like the nflthen why did they ok this cba you did this idiotfor real they should have a homegrown exemption or something where you get a little discount against the cap for resigning your star playersthis guy needs to shut up loltake less moneythese players are making millions and still its not enough and some dont even want to play games or go to training campwasnt he head of the nbpa in the years the cba was dealtevery guy negotiates for a max contract then wonders why the team is getting blown upblame the cba rightalso idiotic take if you draft well you stay competitive good rookies on value contracts is a blessing not a curse when theyre due for extensions you face a decision sure but thats hardly a punishment calling making tough decisions on roster building punishment is funnywhy cant we just play with our best friends and make million each and stay together foreveri think hes gonna be good at thisthis dude acting like he aint the reason why this new cba is dogshityou did this motherfucker omg you braindead fucking warrior hater you literally dicked the whole league over because the warriors gangstomped you and dame every year because tb are trash as an organizationpeople do you like paywin i dont so yeah im very happy about the nd apron every sport league should be more like the nfl in how close the top and bottom spending teams are i say the nba didnt go far enough raise the salary floor higher so even if a team tanks they have to pay players raise the cap closer to the nd apron to allow team to spend easier but at the same time make the nd apron even harsher so they dont even dream of going above itstill waiting to see what team is being punished for drafting wellnot biased at all cjbaofcourse he wants teams to get cap relief for drafting talent that means another avenue for players to earn without it affecting the cap salary inflationteams dont get punished for drafting well they receive players who if they cant pay then all like okc will be able to trade their smaller contracts before they go onto a max for stars or further draft capitali heard cj is a dick irl based off people who met himfuck youits the nba you always get punished for being good and subsidized for being horrible a perversion of pro sportsi hate pedophiles jeffrey epsteinso did nba youngboy what drafted homegrown team has been broken up because of the cba celtics didnt draft porzingis or jrue and the suns didnt draft durant or beali think you are seriously overestimating how much say in things cj or any president of the nbpa has i highly doubt the league would actually give that much power to the players it seems more like a position that exists so that players can have an easier path into management post playing careerevery word out of his mouth ever spokenorange manmaradona participated in antidrug rallies after snorting linesone of the best comments ive seen on herevon vonthe correction would be a new face of the franchise exception which would allow a team to designate max salary player to be exempt from tax calculations this makes it easier to keep a core together for a little longer without the huge tax penaltiesthe second apron only prevents teams from getting out of jail for free when they make a bad decision and spend too much doing itevery team is allowed to keep their own guys they just give up flexibilityi disagree with the premise of what cj said but as the cap continues to rise a or of the cap max player salary seems reasonable having players players on the downside of their careers making of the cap seems bad for the leaguemaybe a good start would be to have supermax contracts only count like max contracts against the salary cap and luxury tax andor have when a player signs multiple year contracts in a row with the same team give a small discount against the salary capunless your name is sgalol cj negotiated for this who set that system up cjthats why the supermax should be counted as regular max in the cap hit the condition of course is if the player started his rookie year with the same teamcj at the next nbpa meeting in a hot dog suit visiting with kuminga giddey and cam thomas mean so far the teams that have broken up are the celtics who brought in several max guys and the suns the thunder arent even over the cap yet this idea that drafted teams are being broken up is just ludicroushes trying jenniferlmao my exact first reactionhes not even right though okc just handed out fat extensionsnah the new cba is amazing for the players this is on the owners lmaohe still signed off on it the governor of a state doesnt do most of the work for a bill but theyre still responsible for its consequences especially if later he shit talks the very bill he signedthat makes it even worseno one with half a brains ever gonna want to do the job either if they get all the blameyou clearly dont understand how labor negotiations workedit lol what a baby blocking people because you dont know what youre talking aboutnot to mention the players have pretty much no leverage its a rough job tbhi love that this narrative of you cant resign star players has somehow persisted through one of the smallestmarket teams easily resigning three star players to massive dealsyeah and on the other hand the teams that were broken up were boston and the suns who both assembled stars through trades i think it did what it was supposed to dookc would only be punished if they now stopped drafting well and had no decent players on cheap contracts filling the rosterother than that i dont think thats cjs issue anyway he isnt there to make things fair for the teams hes there to get the best for the players and we saw one issue this season it happened to luka a team can just decide to completely deny the supermax by trading the player costing the player hundreds of millions thats something he should look intothey should start with the two large contracts of guys who they didnt draftexactly okc has max players of the cap and people seem to think they should be able to spend an infinite amount as long as they draft well that defeats the purpose of the whole cba which was about parity in the first place the main thing thats changed is teams gifting every player with potential max contracts for fear of losing them in a free agent market where no one ever has cap to spend rich paul just said bi doesnt get the same contract if he goes to fa but for some reason teams keep extending dudes to ridiculous dollar amounts that hinder them laterthe problem is that sports fans traditionally like it a lot more and viewershipcasual fan engagement is much higher when teams with familiar faces and casts of characters can stay together for longer periods of time vs having to shuffle out of the roster every other year with random dudes on minimums that will have zero connection with the fanbase human beings like familiarityfor a perfect example of this concept look at how much more popular college basketball was in the previous generation when you had guys like ewing jordan grant hill laettner tim duncan staying in school for years and had whole character arcs redemption narratives multiple tournament runs where they developed rivalries against other teamsplayers bouncing back from crushing defeats to come back the next year and win it all etc all the shit people love about sportsnow you have one and done compounded with the transfer portal and most of the top teams are literally top to bottom brand new rosters of different random guys every single year and surprise the culture largely doesnt give a shit about college basketball anymore bc its too hard to keep track of this stuff you used to be able to just turn on a random game and youd instantly be able to recognize half the players on both teams now its just a bunch of random npcs who go to school for months and then leave before anyone gets a chance to remember their namesobviously the nba isnt that extreme but the same concept applies its not a coincidence that the last years the nba finals having differentunfamiliar teams playing every year has directly coincided with of the worst finals tv ratings of all time compared to less than a decade ago when you had the repeat cavs warriors matchups which got nearly double the viewership of the last yearspeople always claim they love parity more than anything but historically the viewershippopularity spikes suggest the oppositeidk but enough parrots have jumped on the bandwagon so its only a matter of time until it gets reverted and like franchises trade finals for two decades nevermind that the nfl functions just fine with a hard cap and nobody considers that punishment for drafting well smh my headso basically the parity is ensured by ping pong balls thats what pro sports is abouti think this line is coming from the same temporarily embarrassed millionaire mindset that so many people have fans imagine this future scenario where their favorite team has three four five maxsupermax guys and cant keep themit keeps getting framed as punishment for drafting well obviously it isnt when really this cba rewards actual consistently good gm work to fill in the gaps around starswhat this essentially boils down to is we should be able to give nonmax talent players max contracts without it fucking up our cap sheet holmgren and williams are not in terms of skill max contract players but okc had to give them max contracts so people think that bad business decisions should be excused just because its a guy you draftedexactly sga wasnt drafted either so when his cap hit comes its the same thing nobody has drafted too many stars to pay teams have drafted stars that need to be paid and brought in guys that made it difficultwell i doubt the suns blow it up for durantbeal if they had been able to afford paying all of bookeraytonbridgesjohnson and still stay competitiveyou think cj of all people has the final goahead to make all decisions for the cba the dude probably did all he could there are bigger powers at play here and hes bringing it up to further extend the discussions he probably had against itcj does not call all the shots and the players need to compromise with the owners interestsi think he is hinting that they might be negotiating a small change in the cbaits not about building a contender its keeping it together youre going to see a lot of teams in the next few years start tearing it down like the celtics did this year look at the cavs payroll they basically have a year window like the celtics did and then are going to have to salary dump some combo of garland allen and hunter are as good as gone by summer thunder are going to start losing guys like hartenstein caruso or dort in the next years when holmgren and jdub extensions kick infor a team like the warriors that got the benefit of adding a kevin durant rental and keeping their trio that won together for another years while replacing durants money with wiggins in the middle of it it feels a bit unfair for current teams that are punished for being that far into the tax compared to what started this cba in the first placeteams can be cheap keep guys on small contracts and win early like the thunder did and they still will run into the same problems how is any other team realistically supposed to build a contender that lasts more than years without being that fortunatethis cba is a dynasty killer because you cant just piecemeal depth like past super teams have done youre locked out from buyouts certain trades and contract offersnobody has fully figured this out yet because were at the midpoint of teams still overpaying nd and rd options max money to retain them but under the new cba so that becomes a massive problema team like the nuggets paying jamal murray and mpj became a massive problem for them when they had no bench last season had brooklyn not had cap space theyd be screwed with those contracts when in the past it was much easier to move off of big moneygms have to figure out payroll and contracts quick or these overpaid guys are going to cycle around the league weve already seen it with jrue holiday desmond bane michael porter jr karl anthony towns guys dumped for financial flexibility a lot more guys in that m range teams are going to have to find a way to move them elsewhere when the nd apron becomes relevant to them i suspect anunoby is going to become a huge problem for ny as they go over the nd apron and thats even with jalen brunson seeing the writing on the wall and taking a pay cut a lot more guys are going to have to do that if you want to keep a team together longer whether thats the gm being savvy or the players understanding the financial sacrifice to winplayer empowerment era is over the owners got tired of handing out max contracts just to be forced to trade those guys after a year its not surprising the players are not thrilled they cant get paid and team hop like they could beforetldr sorry for the massive wall of text i got carried away just sort of explaining the players cj here arent too happy with this because they dont have as much freedom as they used to they didnt want superteams like the durant warriors or how the nets formed but maybe didnt understand the individual financial consequences of accomplishing that is my best guesspeople want their teams to pay all their players as much as possible and have extreme flexibility ifwhen one of those deals doesnt work outnobody is being punished for drafting well everyone is allowed to pay their own players you just lose flexibilitythat flexibility used to be purely financial but now its tangiblebecause they still get of bri regardless a hard cap is good for most players because it makes their salaries more predictableyeah or for hoarding draft picks like smaugs treasure thats what the jazz and thunder did and idk if its great for the gameheres my one along with perhaps increased ranking concern about making cap exceptions for players drafted it promotes one type of team building over every other and i do wonder if teambuilding diversity would suffer because of ityes the current system doesnt punish teams for drafting well but changing the rules would certainly punish any form of team building that isnt hardcore tanking to draft highunless you are the warriors nuggets bucks heat pacers celtics spurs etcthat makes draft picks way op and tanking way too strongalso the big picks just got even more ridiculously valuable as if they needed any help congrats mavs not only did you luck into flagg his salary only counts for against the capyes it also isnt actually punishing the thunder for drafting well just making it so they cant become even more of a superduperteam than their drafting has already made themhe acts like this just became a problem for only okc klay would still be a warrior if there were no restrictions but i dont recall a cj clip last year gtfohhe fucked it up in the first placethe warriorsthats how they all work lolunless we were to implement some sort of relegation system this is how it has to work in an attempt at parityisnt this true of all four big pro sports leaguesvigilantes are a stain on our society batmangive epstein credit on one thing he did allegedly kill one pedoself hate is a very common thingkat is probably the biggest example but even that was probably sped up with gobert joiningif thats how were looking at it what drafted homegrown team has existed every winning team has made at least a couple trades or free agent signingsthunder next yeardont you remember the big in durant westbrook and hardeni mean its only existed for a very brief window of time obviously there arent going to be a million examples to cite but the point is in a previous era teams like the celtics or thunder would have been able to retain a coherent team core for a much longer period of time like the mj bulls or s celtics having a ton of the same players for multiple runs instead of what is going to happen now going forward where you lock up your top or players and then completely shuffle the rest of the players out every other year and probably trade one of the big star contracts at some point when you otherwise wouldnt have done sothey just so happened to do ok in the aftermath but minnesota trading kat is another example of a team breaking up the doncic trade is more of an outlier but also another somewhat related example of a financially motivated move that likely wouldnt have happened in a differentless restrictive cap eradallas the wolves pacers and warriorshe also means teams that owns a players bird rightsdesmond bane got traded this offseason dudenot a great comparison but the knicks basicly had to trade rj and quick because of itno they have to make sure they have that say in it otherwise theyll end up eventually like the nfl without guaranteed contracts dont sleep on greedy ownersthe tax exemptions should apply to anyone on an escalator example being sgas cap hit being but his value on the tax being limited to the because of his yosbillionaires love tax breaksor just make all of them exempt from tax calculations why just the idea is to keep players you drafted if only is exempt then youre still punishing teams that draft wellps ignore my flair honestly second apron was really to curtail what was transpiring into a snowball effect of overspending we know how small market teams have to put in work to get themselves competitive enough to the big marketsgsw with its new arena and move from oakland to san francisco brought in a fuckton of money which the owner bankrolled into paying the luxury tax and going over the soft cap it was an arms race from there la clippers owner alone could outspend in the billions and not even feel it which if you go by owners net worth like the next owners behind him are worth that combined the second apron is punishment to stop that practice from ever happening again what they have to adjust is if your drafted players sticks with you for the long haul every contract reup should remove a off most players get contracts during their playing career then just use a number that makes team longevity a benefit for them still getting paid but also allowing the team to be built around them youre going to have supermax contracts that are gonna get absurdly pricey as we approach players hitting figure salaries with his the increase is coming with the new tv contracts the league knows its gotta keep it partners happy and try to keep the league growing or they will have to shrink which i highly doubt any side wants thatwhy are we artificially capping players earnings if a team wants to tie up of their cap in one player the player deserves to earn that moneyhes the figure head who represents the players interests its all lawyers who are figuring it out its not like hes personally hashing out all the numbers with adam silverplayers endorsed him to give up things for weedsagreed a suggestion i read which you can apply on top of that is that for each year with a team the supermax counts against the cap less retaining players gets rewarded regardless of who drafted themthis is said so often it boggles my mind how the league does not immediately implement ithonestly i think it shouldnt be the super max i would rather love it if like of players salary who played their rookie season at your clubso players traded right after draft count for the club they actually play for wasnt counted against the cap of course is just a number i just made up it could be or whatever but this would encourage teams to hang on to their drafted role players too not just the superstars be cause honestly as a fan i know i like some of the guys that we draft even if they are not a superstar this would also make later picks a bit more valuable because it means you might get a better role player for your cap space if you drafted themthese comments are all copypasted from the last time this was posted yall want upvotes that muchthe thunder are about to have something like of the nd apron salary threshold locked down on players if they get allnba honours thats likely going to break them upthe celts are being broken up because of the two max guys they drafted though they traded for white and kp at nadirs in their value using players they drafted well and traded at the right timeeven if they still had nesmith smart grant williams robert williams theyd have to be offloading those guys right nowit is what it is the reason the celtics got kind of hosed is bc they were only given a couple of years notice about the second apron stuff and it was still after they had gone down the time to win a title road thunder have started their road after the cba was known so they should be able to plan better for it contracts will be adjusted moving forward and this new cba wont be as big of an issue in two yearsdid the celtics draft any players on max contracts currentlyminnesota had to ditch kat but arguable about if it was solely due to the new cbayeah the best way to be competitive is to draft well consistently so you always have low salary players on your rosterand thats pretty much it for them its going to be hard to keep literally anyone else on that roster or even keep those together for the full length of their contractsthis is correct however they will absolutely be punished with a huge tax and eventually have to make the decision to move on from one of those guys the key is always correctly managing your assets for example if they trade chet they should be compensated with picks who they can turn into young players initially performing way above their valueyea issue will come when those contracts kick in then the likes of ihart who always was a short term loan dort caruso and caso will become the ones who have to make way big will take up of the cap when it kicks in thatll fuck over the team no matter how good presti isyeah but the assumption is that those contracts will make it very difficult to build a complete team even though thats just what happens when you draft well this cba definitely makes championship windows shorter by making it financially difficult to keep the squads togetherbut they better win all the championships for the next years lose even one and its off to the glue factory for chet and jduband now youll see the effects of that over the next few years the celtics didnt have a problem the first year after they signed the large extensions but the celtics fo saw the writing on the wall and went all in to get jrue and zingus before having to blow it up in an alternate universe where the jrue and zingus trades didnt happen the celtics would still have had to have traded some of their drafted and homegrown talent altho it seems smart and rob williams value has cratered enough for the celtics to sign them for cheapthe same is going to happen to okc okcs will soon be forced to start letting some of their drafted players go hopefully trade for more picks and fill their team with low cost vets and young players on rookie contractsim not sure what people even want do you want parity or do you want to let a team that gets lucky moves up a couple draft spots drafts well and then has a year grip on the nbawhat does that prove the extensions havent kicked in an outlier scenario where the contracts havent even kicked in isnt a good argumentand soon theyll lose key players to other teams that have more money at their disposalwhich they have to sacrifice the rest of their team over hartenstein and caruso as examples propably deserve more money than holmgren and have put okc over the hump they propably have to leave soonnot all players if there wasnt such heavy penalties for the nd apron there are quite a few players that would likely be paid a little more or wouldnt have had their lives upended by being traded by teams trying to avoid the nd apronthe ceos dont do all the paperwork and admin work but they overview and approve seems redditors never had a high level management jobso cj is like a trump type leader of the nba unionnegotiate deez they havent actually started paying all three players well see what happens in the next few years okc has max players of the capno they dontfor the season they have one max player sga one guy making million chet and one guy making million jdub its only starting in that theyll have three max guys and im willing to bet that okc will have a firesale for the rest of their roster in order to stay under the nd apronits of the cap and if dub gets st team more than likely since theres a world where he gets nd team all nbawiggins joe jwill ajay all on cheap descending or flat long term deals for m cason is a question markcaruso and hart are likely out team option on dort yall really dont know what youre talkin about okc is in an incredible position to sustain thisthats true fans love superteams i think teams can keep running their cores back as long as they dont hand out maxes like candy though even the thunder are being smart and not giving chetjdub the default max escalators for their extensions itll still be harder to maintain dominance but we were already seeing that pre cba its such a physical grind to make deep playoff runs year after year lots of champs just got injured or ran out of gas the next yearthe odds of drafting decently to really good are high for most teams now its pointless to exclude draft picks from capapron spacei think holmgren and williams would command maxes on the open market mpj and murray probably would notdurant beal were paid million last year aytonbridgesjohnson were paid millionhis job was to create awareness and consensus among players after exploring the pros and cons of the deal he refuted many of the concerns at the time that hes raising himself now he failed at his basic rolei really dont think people understand what the actions after miami dynasty but alot players confuse miami in player empowerment when they never forced there way out those dudes were all free agents i believe minus boshthe owners and imo rightfully so never wanted to be treated how kdhardenkyrie pg etc handled that period they broke the unspoken rules and honestly were just assholes and forced there way out of situations after signing and while still under contractwe just hadnt seen so many players trying and successfully forcing there way out it did become a bit unprofessional at some point guys you have to honor your damn contract you are getting paid a boat load idc if you guessed wrong once you wanted out and found another landing spotchampions losing role players isnt cause of this cba its been happening for a long time those teams could have kept those guys together if they were good enough the nuggets had no bench cause they made terrible decisions in the drafts and on the marginsall those guys got traded cause they were overpaid or got great deals in return like kat and banegood stuff it gets really interesting from here on out since agents dont have the leverage they once had this is especially hard on the middle class of the leagueall that was needed to prevent a future durant warriors situation was cap smoothing instead of a cap spike none of the new cbas we need to punish big spenders stuff has anything to do with that iteration of the team the durant warriors were not big spendersall under the old cba though and done before the new one was even negotiatedwe still have to cycle through all the deals made under the old cbabasically the only guy on the bucks title team that they drafted was gianniswarriors got screwed because they kept rolling over kds salary to dlo then wiggins and now butler all stemming from a guy they didnt draftthe mavs getting the pick is an indication that tanking isnt really all that viable of a strategysorry sthey whiffed on multiple lottery picks and their good picks are just getting old they had the chance to draft well and continue their run but they didntno just the american mbappe doesnt play for gijonyeah but false for literally every other sport in the world the us leagues are the weirdosyou dont see verstappen racing for sauberno joke superman once said basically this to batman the cape is coming from inside the househitler killed hitlerhe likely didnt thoughgobert joining as well as naz reid breaking through so welli think there is a big difference between making some trades and some free agent signings and essentially perpetuating a max contract slot by trading for bird rights that allows you to have a full max contract over the cap thats what the celtics did and its what your team did with the durant into wiggins trade i dont think teams should have max contract guys kind of defeats the entire systemi think theres a reasonable middle ground where you can say if a teams x best players anywhere between to depending how big the gap is between the rest were drafted and theres not a player making y of salary cap somewhere between to be clearly above mle that wasnt drafted you can reasonably say home grownone example i can think of would be thunder that made the finals top players kd harden westbrook were all drafted by okcseattle their th best ibaka was as well best nondrafted player who was also biggest non drafted salary is kendrick perkins at m of the cap at the timeanother example would be spurs top players and biggest salaries duncan ginobili and parker all drafted by the team next largest salary was brent barry at around of salary cap at the time the gap between the big and bowen finley oberto level guys was imo sufficiently large enough to differentiatethink hes more saying it wasnt cj negotiating with the owners both sides have representation he doesnt have that much sway at allthe thing is they need to define well which guy is homegrowm sga for example was acquired in a trade and played his rookie year in lacbecause the idea of a cap in general is less about keeping teams together than forcing some type of parity allowing all drafted players to be tax exempt theoretically allows a team enough cap to sign free market max players on a team that already has multiple max players they drafted then the league becomes the mlb where ultimately large market teams can outspend small markets by a large magnitudethe definition shouldnt just be drafted players for example sga played his rookie year in lacit is bad for the rest of the bargaining unit given that all player salaries come out of a fixed percentage of brithe reality is that maybe players are actually worth of the cap the fact that there is a maximum means that teams dont have any real bargaining power to resign their starsby that logic why do we have a cap on salaries at allhonestly theres maybe a handful that deserve it hell right now it would be say lebron steph giannis luka sga jokic that can truly warrant itplayers earnings are already capped by max contracts the problem is teams feel compelled to offer max contracts to players that probably dont warrant max contracts just to get them to stay and then half of those players sign the max and demand a trade within the next two years anywaywhat the nba needs is a market correction specifically for btier players i think this new cba can help bring that correction about over time but in the meantime while some of these legacy contracts are still on the books some teams will have problemsi also disagree with the idea that this cba penalizes teams for drafting well so far the only teams that are being penalized are teams that traded for maxlevel vets in an effort to extend their title windows celtics bucks suns the pacers could have kept turner but he chose to leave and okc probably has some choices to make but they were facing similar choices years ago when they decided to trade james harden small market teams will always have to be more disciplinedthe real person is the executive director who does the bulk of the work the current executive director is now andre iguodalamany people raised this exact red flag at the time as well and he went on a media tour defending the deal its not like he was blindsided it was a very obvious artifact of the nd apron rules which is effectively a hard capi dont understand this do people really think the committee of players who are responsible for bargaining shouldnt be expected to understand the contract theyre bargaining for the lawyers work for them lawyers dont decide the bargaining priorities the union leadership does but he above all other players should be aware of whats going on and should have the opportunity to be debriefed on all of it more than anyoneyou clearly dont understand how labor negotiation work if you think the lawyers are the ones running the showsome sort of loyalty discount on the cap hit based on number of years that player stayed with the team it will also help with older stars who are inclined to stay in the franchise but sometimes the franchise need that cap space so they cant play their older starsort of like that wade scenario in miami steph and draymond will encounter this as welli mean a minimax is of the cap theres realistically no way to fix thischets max is the with no escalators for williams if he makes st teammvpdpoy for sga is of the salary cap and of the way to the nd apronwow having all nba players locked up for a long time sounds super punishingeven if chet and jalen got full maxes they wouldnt all add up to of the nd apron the celts are being broken up because of the two max guys they drafted thoughin my view what the celtics are going through is partly due to the cba but also the decision was made when tatum got injured a healthy tatumbrown changes things and the decision the front offices makes the moment tatum went down everything shifted for their timeline and it became absolutely not worth it to overspendwhat will really determine things with the cba will be how the thunder operate in yearsthis is intelligence of a hornets fan not surprised tbhya the ones still on the team lolthey absolutely could have kept kat if thats what they really wanted to do they made a basketball decisionalternatively play in a nice city so you can attract veterans on the minimumalso if you draft well you can trade that player for more assets no one looks at the nfl which straight up uses a hard cap and thinks drafting well is an issuestill sounds like a massive fucking win they won a title will be the title favorites for the next couple seasons and have their homegrown talents locked up with contracts thats a great reward for drafting well im not sure what more people wantwell they have two huge deals for guys they didnt draft maybe let them goyou were nice to that personyeah but theres always been a limit to how long large cores of teams can remain together this isnt some new development with the new cbathe key is always correctly managing your assets thats how they are here in the first place the trades they made are just as important if not more important than the actual picks they madeare they suddenly not allowed to keep players anymore they have bird rights on everyonegiving up roster flexibility to have a deep team has always been the give and take with nba teams they used to use the luxury tax to alleviate this but some owners decided to burn money so this is the resultyeah i definitely envision chet or maybe williams being moved in a few years but this doesnt seem any different from so many great teams in the past years you build a great squad you win and then you lose some of your players and have to shift the way you built the team idk why cj is making it seem like this new cba is completely at fault anytime a team has to extend guys at the same time this will happenare you densewhich is how it has been for years no team can retain key players over a year span this cba didnt create that scenariohartenstein and caruso two players they didnt draft i dont see much of a problem with thisihart is for sure out the door after this year but i think dort gets traded before caruso id be shocked if chet finishes this contract with okc hes not a milyear level player rn and injuries and limited opportunity could very well keep him from realizing his potential good on okc keeping this team together tho this was realistically the only way you could get one more run out of this squad as is before you have to start making choices and replacing role playersi can tell you its not very funtheyre obviously going to have to make sacrifices with the depth but thats kind of the point if you want good depth with three megadeals you have to be smart about it you can retain your drafted stars just fine but theres no reason any team should be able to have three maxes and still splurge on big deals for role playersyoure misunderstanding me im using okc as an example because the tax isnt hindering them they dont need to sign a bunch of guys to albatross contracts because they know how to run their organization and draft well so they can keep swapping out role players once they become to expensive this is exactly what the cba was intended to do which is why i dont understand the complaining of itthe whole draft is pointlesshonestly if i played in the nba i wouldnt even really trust fellow players to negotiate or communicate for me i feel like that wouldve been the case many decades ago when players came into the nba having taken their education seriously and there were super switched on players like kareem running around ignoring all the problematic elements around the college system that i see as a nonamericanits almost an intentional clusterfuck now you cant blame mccollum the structures in place are not there to protect the game its either players make the nba slightly worse to make money or owners make the nba slightly worse to make money right now its looking like the latter to me but for players not getting the max its also betterlol thats not what he said and if thats what you got from that sighoh sure but this cba is pushing more people to do thatkhris middleton was the th pick and they got him from the pistons bench so i consider him also a scouted talent by the bucksdid you really just say tanking is not a viable strategy wtf lol youre probably alluding to the fact that the mavs were a th seed that just means they lucked out they only had a chance of getting the pick cooper flagg will alter the course of the mavs franchise for the better just as they would have for any of the other teams tanking for him it was well worth to try and tank for him and if it were to be redone the teams would still tank mavs just got luckyah you responded before i could finish my edit relegation is good in theory but its objectively worse for parity look at the dynasties that exist in international soccerya and f and euro soccer just come down to who spends the most money rivetingverstappen might rather be in a sauber right nowred bulls current car is ass my dude hes the one thing keeping that team from being down with alpineits just cultural differences theres a reason why a lot of the sports popular around the world dont do all that well in the us over here you compete to be the best of the best at all times or youre not worth paying attention to its a highly toxic culture but thats what it is the thing international fans dont understand is that us fans only care about the highlevel stuff they dont give a crap about anything under that level and dont see how or why yall do it to use your example sauber still has dedicated fans that deeply appreciate their efforts at the level theyre able to complete they dont care that verstappen doesnt and would never race for them that level of support would not be possible in the us sauber would only be supported by diehard fans and would constantly be at risk of shutting down due to lack of support whoever verstappen raced for and against would garner almost all of the attention and profit when us fans argue for relegation being instituted its just as much for determining which teams deserve to be ignored as it is for adding legitimate stakes to matches and recordswithout the attempt at parity every us sports league would eventually turn into some form of the harlem globetrotters vs the washington generals the level of rabid support that lowerleague franchisesbrands enjoy internationally just wouldnt happen in the us our cultural and economic standards simply dont support the level of relegation needed to make the let the best play foragainst the best and to each level their own model that so many internationally popular sports followgood guy hilterdeletedwhile it seems suspicious you know that idiot trump would have taken credit for it if he was involved just waiting for the news conference and him slipping in i did the country a favor and i had him killedvalid point and i tend to agree although i think the money part is separate from the drafting partlike if harrison barnes became a superstar player and the warriors just kept him all this time they would have maxes just the same but breaking them up would then be punishing them for drafting wellok makes senseescalator eligibility guys who get traded after just season countsga and khris middleton only other prominent guy i could think of are definitely homegrown for okc and milwaukeeif your argument is that it would benefit big markets i would disagree unless all big market teams start drafting better they all currently suck at it none of the big market stars are drafted by those teams also theres a lot of rules in the cba that makes building a roster when above the cap more difficult these rules help with parity the second apron will still be there and the repeater tax these would keep teams within spending limits even big marketrich ownership groupswell we can workout on the language maybe a better bonus if you get drafted and fully stay traded and you get some cooldown but it carries over and if you leave through free agency then youre reset i mean i know i didnt full put in the thought of it but theres better people than me to figure that shit outalso i think the league being so hesitant to adding more teams to stretch out the player pool and the players side getting another say players if teams were added in could help lower the salary threshold cause it would be more evenly spread out last team as the th was bobcats in almost years ago before that was raptors and grizzlies in so years to go to and then nothing till present by now we should be at least teams i might be thinking incorrectly herei generally think it would be fairer to not have a max salaryfate of the cba on the line nd apron pointed at the planet i want iguodalawho took over the position after the negotiation had concludedyes im sure iggy negotiated the fine details of the cba lmfaoiggy knows all too well he is a very intelligent nba playerthe players should have had either jeremy lin or jaylen brown structure the cba seeing as they studied at harvarddawg the players make so much motherfucking money lol that is the nbapa goal at the end of the day this idea that the nbapa failed homegrown stars when booker is making million a year is insanei like that but i specifically want it for guys your team drafted i think its healthy for the draft to be important and i think it would be cool if fans could get really hyped even for a solid benchplayer because they know even that bench player will help with the cap situation if he hits this makes picks in the range much more exciting because there is a reward even if the player is not a superstarexemptions from the cap for drafted players is an easy way to reward drafting well would also make draft day more entertaining because more teams would make trades to ensure theyre the ones who draft the player for those exemptionsedit just make it so that draft exemption doesnt follow the player like bird rights do its solely for the team that originally called their name on draft day draft trades dont count either you want the draft exemption trade to move updown spots in the draftand they have to field other guys on of that salary doesnt seem very realisticpossibleany team would trade a player if they can stay as competitive while reducing their cap wolves bet on randle donte being as good as kat and they wereyou sure you dont work for the clippersthe nfl also doesnt generally have fully guaranteed contracts for veterans so you can cut the overpriced veteran to keep the young playerthey won a title will be the title favorites for the next couple seasons and have their homegrown talents locked up on contractsi remember when people said that about my celtics smhapparently they think that there should be no downside to it but salary caps exist for a reason it is up to the team to manage itthe bucks nuggets and celtics are all really great examples of how quickly that can change though nuggets were shit on constantly for not keeping kcp when contractually it wouldve come with consequences lose him and they lose as a resulthad to quickly get off of mpj the following year thankfully they were able to do that for a great player and contract brauns extension is coming up really important beloved part of their core then theyll be right back up against the apron once hes paidi dont see how braun watson strawther all get fair extensions along with cam johnson eventuallythey just want to shit on the cba lol the teams that have broken up are the celtics and suns and the guys they got rid of werent the guys they draftedplease god do not make us sit through a couple more seasons of boring okc basketball in prime timeyeah just need to hoard picks by acting like the receptacle bin for every bad contract in the league for years get lucky in terms of other teams options and plans and then draft well in order to sustain a window should be doablecant lose aaron gordon thats for sureyea i dont get why people acting like okc losing role players after seasons of contention is a big deal the spurs and warriors lost plenty of role players during their runs this isnt a new thingthey can keep players but are heavily penalized in terms of huge taxes a hard cap trade limitations no use of exceptions and repeat offenders get their picks moved to the end of the rounddoes it really make a difference wether they are drafted or aquired over the market its about not being able to retain players that deserve itcaruso is older than dort and cant play as much idk how much dort will be paid on his next deal but they got to keep him and chet is a dpoy caliber player who can space the floor its like guys in the nba anywhere close to him and one is wemby other than sga hes the most important guy for them in the playoffsyeah they will trade holmgren for gobertcoolname me a successful tank effort the last real one that worked was years ago for lebron it fails constantlyand yall way overhyping flaggyeah but its pro sports its about figuring out who is the best not subsidize everyone until they can hang with the best thats like letting asafa powell only run m so he can keep up with usain bolt parity should be irrelevant in pro sportsi rather have it evolve around investing than just being shittybut he wont because in the f perfomance counts and not the need for parity like basically in every other sportwow and he was a misogynist on top of everything elsehes a big idiot but not idiot enough to confess to a murder which will likely be known to be a cover upbecause as we all strongly suspect he wasnt best friends with dude for many years without partaking in that stuff especially given everything else we know about trumpi think punishing teams for drafting well is what any salary cap does though and the nba needs a salary capggiannisfairer to whoso then tamika tremagliowait wtf jaylen brown studied at harvard but was a vaccine skeptic he mustve skipped every single class theni thought brown went to berkeleyi dont disagree but thats a separate issue from the players union rep himself arguing against a cba that he ushered inthey did fail if everyone outside of superstars have to take lessthey screwed the middling players who dont have clear defined rolesbut as some others pointed out there will be outliers like sga who is essentially homegrown even roleplayers like rui hachimura who flourished in the lakers than in washingtonbasing it on years of service i think captures those type of guys draft trades dont count eitherthis seems overly draconian but i think i could get behind the restthe players wouldnt want this though even if the salary is exempted from a teams cap it still counts towards the players collective revenue split if it doesnt count towards the cap there would be no mechanism to make sure other teams spend less so the every other player would end up having to give back moneythe problem is this means that it will reduce the ability of players to change teams without losing a lot of money which the players dont wanthonestly i think it would be fine if you just had to draft or trade for them on their rookie contractthey wont make of the second apron and even if they did a team could go over itpats headi agree just saying the cba boogyman didnt force them to lose their guy even ifnit was a factor in their decision to ship their guy outthe clippers exist to sell jerseys and they barely do that wellnah but definitely worked out for the lakers got a chip out of itshit they let veterans still with years good on them for thth round picks money moved and draft capital gainedi mean the celtics probably would be among the favorites going into next season if tatum didnt tear his achillesyou guys had a year window where you lost in the finals choked against the seed heat won the finals and had tatum tear his achilles you made several moves in that timeframe that maximized that window at the expense of future flexibility is a year title window a bad thing nowim less familiar with whats led to the bucks downfall but boston had an extremely nice window to win titles that would probably still be open if tatum didnt get injureddenver is a great example of the system working imo besides the apron punishments kicking in too soon possibly i can see the argument that teams shouldve had more time to prepare theyre retaining the talented players they drafted or in the case of mpj they were able to trade him for another comparably good player not being able to resign certain players should be a natural consequence of a salary cap teams shouldnt be entitled to retaining every free agent theyve signed along with retaining all of their draft picks the entire point is that theres a budget that all teams are limited by equallythe nuggets are the only team that got truly fucked by the cba because they signed all their guys right before the cba was announced all of the other teams made their deals knowing about the second apronalso celtics made the changes they did because of tatums injury they would have made different choices if that didnt happenwere supposed to feel bad for the nbas most blessed franchise having some difficulties theyre going to be competing again when tatum is healthy and honest theyll probably still make the playoffshow on earth is okc basketball boring the thunder yea i dont get why people acting like okc losing role players after seasons of contention is a big dealand if they want to replace those good role players they can just go back to what got them the title in the first place and draft wellthe tax stuff was already there it was a de facto hard cap they dont get the tax mle but most deep tax teams wouldnt use it anyway only real problem is the picks thing and you have to be in it for like out of yearsthe premise of people shitting on cj here is that they think the cba hurts peoples ability to keep homegrown talentpersonally not really but i dont see how teams are being punished for drafting well in this scenario you shouldnt be able to completely circumvent the salary cap because you drafted well okc is paying their young studs what theyre worth and because of that theyll have limited money for other roster spotsi mean do you think there just shouldnt be any luxury tax or negative pressure on spending period itd just mean in the long run whichever teams owner is willing to splash the most cash will end up winningimagine forgetting that the reigning champs okc tanked they pretty blatantly tanked for years in and which directly netted them chet holmgrem and indirectly carusothe warriors drafted curry klay draymond harrison barnes and others and won championships you can argue it was not an intentional tank but they sucked year after year and their good draft picks got them championships obviously showing the power of good draftingspurs tanked and got wemby not enough time has passed to make a championship push but obviously spurs are happy they tankedand theres other stories like the sixers of course it didnt work out for them but it was not due to tanking not working out it was a consensus that the process reaped huge benefits the problem was what they did after the tankingflagg is not overhyped you underestimate the value of a superstarparity should be irrelevant in pro sportsits the entertainment business man pro sports dies if people lose interestthen why does la liga have a scl if parity is irrelevanthaving whoever wins just be a billionaire spending competition is so beyond stupidhow rich is the asshole that owns my team this is why we play the gameactually they have implemented several steps along the line towards parity notably cost cap and more will likely come down the pipe in the futureif you want f without nods to parity youre about fortyfive fifty years too latenot that red bull needed any of those steps to field a car thats kinda slow and quite hard to drive in official duties hes immune kind of like him screaming about obama being a traitor well dumbass you gave presidents immunity in their official duties so can you stfu nowwhy does it need a salary capgiannis wasnt traded hes a y vet anyway hes eligible for and shouldnt get any tax reliefwhat youll sometimes find with smart people is that they confuse being smart in one or some areas with being smart in every discipline dont know what jaylen studied but i doubt it was vaccine science a possible explanationim certain there are antivaxers that attend or have attended harvard formal education alone isnt always enough to inform people or sway them enough to hold better beliefsless than what mles are generational wealth if guys like mpj and murray arent max guys on the new cba is that a failure of the players association the old system clearly screwed the middle players even harder you basically had to max your three best guys if you were a contender and that left very little money for anyone elsebut it doesnt reward great drafting i specifically want to encourage careers where a player spends their time entire career at one clubif you thought tanking was pretty extreme already just wait until the only way to build a team is through multiple drafted starsi mean sure im just greedy and want spicier draft nightssorry closer to still trying to make a competitive roster with people and m of salary not to hit the m nd apron threshold is a big ask they can still go over sure but is it worth the hardship and cost i dont see many teams going for it certainly not longtermyall have all those picks youll be aight also the cap and the aprons go up every year mvps have played for your hometown franchise all in their prime and you have ring to show for it crazy how loud okc fans have become only because the achilles tendon isnt more durable lmaoreally a y window as a favorite we just saw a scrappy indy team go to games in the finalstheyve had years of being in contention resulting in ecf losses a finals loss and a finals win boo hoothe repeater tax was crazy for the celtics like close to a total of m in payroll just for this upcoming year and half of that was the tax they were at the very least going to trade away porzingis and probably holiday too to get out of thatnuggets are easily a top team in the nba how did they get fucked they took okc to a hard fought game series before upgrading their team over the summerthey got fucked up because they handed out max deals to non all star playersnumber one its oklahoma number two no stars their biggest name is sga and he looks stoned all the time or something number the fouls just stop the game too much with them boring basketballah gotchu my badlots of trade restrictions as well no aggregation no st no cash the nd apron being a hard cap in season creates some limitations as well like the mavs faced unable to backfill players when they had a ton of injured players nd half of the season forcing them to wait until the last couple weeks to convert way playerskeeping homegrown talent or investing it into something else isnt that different to mei get that but if i look at the timberwolves developing four starter and adding a max player should be sustainable thats great work but its not sustainable for abitrary reasonsno read my other comments salary cap is literally the one parity mechanic i am more than ok with the rest is just complete overregulation and only good for short term exitment the draft around zion williamson was hype sending him to the pelicans is a net minus for the leaguewhich directly netted them chet holmgrem he wasnt even the pick wtf are you on about sga carries that team spurs tanked and got wemby not enough time has passed to make a championship push but obviously spurs are happy they tankedand have continued to lose consistently even with him so they just suck even with him he has like record or something and theres other stories like the sixers of course it didnt work out for them yep just like most of themnot really they just make less money but yeah its closer to entertainment than pro sportsbecause one club is a thousand times richer than everybody else and trust me the salary cap is my favorite parity assuring mechanic the rest is complete nosense you already have the benefit to invest just the same as competedors who are way better why do you need the lottery alsonot the reality you should check what eintracht frankfurt is doing as an example not possible in the nba because their talents would be gifted to heidenheim and bochumi know but they would never ever sent louis hamilton to sauber because they cant keep up with mercedesimagine all the mechanics going through a draft ridicolousdo you want the sport of basketball to be decided by how rich the owners areit doesnt matter what you studied higher education typically leads to increased critical thinking and a general trust in science which jb seems to lack less than what mles are generational wealththis is irrelevant to the question they asked literally any nba player will never have to work another day in their life the day after their rookie contracts alone if theyre smartthe question was is it a win if of the players are making less regardless of if that less is still a hell of a lot of moneyive been a portland fan long enough to see the contracts we gave allen crabbe meyers leonard evan turner jeremi grant and others under previous cbas while still paying big to dame cj and nurkunder old cbas the superstars still made their money and teams could still pay or overpay the middle part of their roster with fewer penalties or restrictionsthe new cba effectively made a rich get richer middle class shrinks version of the nba look at the contracts role players are getting right now and players that still havent gotten deals that would have quickly and easily a couple years agobook gets mil and guys who used to get are now getting still a shit load of money but still a large paycut as a percentage and a symptom of the cbaguys like ayton get bought out now because their contracts were signed in the previous cba and are not tenable slight overpays are now completely untenable untradeable negative assets that teams just have to cut their losses on cant even give them awayyeah but trades are a reality of the nba and its gonna be unfair for guys with rookie contracts who got traded even draft day trades will be an issuethe only issue is the tax money the problem would be if the team wasnt good enough and they had to improve with a trade if they were the best teamin the nba the draft pick getting frozen in years not that big of a deal and okc specifically gas bird rights on all thier guys and has picks to trade if they need toand its million left overyea im not worried about the roster i was just patting the user that thinks its not possible to build around okcs big especially when everything they have is inherited from a beloved and historical franchiseat a time when max deals were regularly given to non all star players yes thats exactly the point they gave the contracts under the old rules which changed basically a day afterlmao were bottom in ft attempts per gamethat matters if the team aint good enough and you have to make moves but if your team needs to make major trades than they shouldnt be in the second apron and teams dont have to hard cap themselves a team like okc can just bring back the same team literally nothing is stopping thatthen just get rid of the salary cap altogether you say the nba should zig while all other leagues are zaggingso tanking only counts if it gets you a pick lol i guess okc should just drop chet then hes worthless rightbro youre going to talk trash on wemby now as if the spurs made did wrong by drafting him youre delusional man imagine going to these lengths just to defend a poorly thought out cap tax ideaits closer to entertainment than pro sportspro sports are entertainment it is in the entertainment industryi want the workers to get a bigger share of the revenue the question was is it a win if of the players are making lessthank you them living in a better resource management position than us doesnt change the fact that the majority doesnt like making less compared to the minoritynobody is taking less money the players get the exact same split around of basketball money there are about the same number of max contracts floating around the league the players lose no moneythe owners have to cut salary but where does it go to another team the celtics didnt cut jrue and porzingis someone else is still paying themwerent crabbe and et both paid during the cap spike threshold is ok where did you rank in the playoffs cuz it was boring af watching them play i can share a highlight reel of the bs sga was putting up trying to get foul calls so even the nocalls had a gamequality effecti mean the fact okc will be paying more in taxes m than the salary cap m in is what eventually stops it they cannot use the tpmle can not st cannot aggregate players in trade to get back a higher salary better playernoooo keep the salary cap and get rid of the draft let rookies go to whoever can offer the most money the best perspective or wherever the fuck they want instead of letting ping pong balls and a disfunctional state in the franchise decide over who gets whosending zion williamson to the pelicans helps absolutly nobodyso tanking only counts if it gets you a pick i think youre fundamentally misunderstanding what tanking is you just consider every team who was bad then got better after a good draft as a successful tank loli also didnt talk trash about wemby i just said the spurs still lose twice as often as they win even with him you seem really emotional about this guy relaxnot really nobody cares for volleyball players and they are prostheir salary gets adjusted for of nba revenue so the cap doesnt affect their salaryin when all contracts kick in the second apron is projected to be and they will make that season if jdub doesnt make allnba he gets or something close if he does make it they wont be anywhere close for the next seasons or they can easily avoid it buy paying ihart less or not having him and kenrich williams getting cut and coming back on the minimumthe threshold goes up brotherand i can make the exact same same highlight reel for nembhard the taxes part isnt even true and okc doesnt even use any of that stuff nowyou have no clue what you are talking about okc sat a healthy al horford for the end of a season thats how blatant their tank waswhy bring up wembys losing record did the spurs do good by tanking to get him or notim genuinely amused at you the lengths someone will go to double and triple down on a bad take are you a childno thats the salary floor which is negotiated separately from the capyou wont find me arguing there indy was only slightly less boring to watch just a relatively weak year with all the major stars underperforming or injured hoping for better things next year wont be paying hartensten mil and kenrich mil they can and will make moves by next season',\n",
       " 'sucks this series was a sweep hakeemshaq never got close to playing another playoff series in their primes another tale of how quickly a series can turn from hopeful to overfantastic videothey were basically unguardable on offense and they were also good passers for the time i guess attracting so much defense on them led them to many easy assistskenny smith was fiesting on those open shots he shot on both title years and in the playoffslast but not least the skyhook is nowadays vanished but its really unstoppable if masteredi miss bigs like these guysdefenses were so different then post play was encouraged cause you couldnt double until they had the ball just a different game i miss it sometimesthe jet had a great game turn over and from assists reboundsshaq was in his nd season hakeem was in his thi would watch hakeem highlights before going to play pickup id finish games like for but that one hook shot was niceclash of the titans good shitthat beautiful lay up attempt in the end is why they call him the glidethe thing that strikes me is how different defense is played against todays bigs almost every single entry pass is simple the defender is between the player and the basket and theres no double team until the player starts their moveif this type of dominance was displayed in todays game from either player every entry pass would be contested players wouldnt be allowed to reach their preferred spot easily and doubleteams would happen at the time the entry pass is made in order to force the ball out of their handsthe offensive moves havent changed too much but the way that team defenses have adapted to superstar play has evolved so much over the yearsas a spurs fan hakeem was a menace for years i was afraid of that manno one hunting for fouls or cry about calls eitherthank you for posting video i dont think a lot of people are familiar with shaq outside his power dunks the guy was amazinghakeem put on a clinic in that series people were ready to anoint shaq as the best center in the league but hakeem was not ready to pass that baton just yetthis destroyed year old me so disappointed penny was my favorite shaq was a beast and at the time i didnt appreciate understand olajuwons greatnessgave birth to this incredible invention never got to see prime shaq vs prime dreamcouple of things first shaqs turnaround on the left block into a one hand right handed jump shot is unbelievable i forgot how cool that shot was no one can replicate that like him and just the touch and speed he has wow second thing hakeem won this series and its a feather in his cap for his all time status man shaq put in work on him like every single basket in this game shaq is going right at hakeem hakeem gets his too but the majority of his baskets arent with shaq guarding him shaq was hakeem was and in his prime context gets lost over the years and all the nuances we discuss in modern big games will get lost to time the same waycrazy how deep these guys were allowed to catch the ball seems like todays defenses can really push the post players a lot further off the blockshaq was really that guy pretty crazys hes honestly underrated appearances championships crazy numbers should be under kareem all time in reality but hard to beat the argument for magicthis series was huge back in the dayman hakeem olajuwon and young shaq were ice cold kenny with the cameoim taking peak hakeem over peak shaq every timeeveryone that keeps saying dream cooked shaq that is not what happened nick anderson choked among otherswhat was going on with that last inbounds pass was it an ooptip attempt that was tossed too high was it supposed to come off the boardwhat was the contest at lolwhat does shaq have to say about olajuwonthank you for the upload what an amazing battle between two of the greatest bigsdream baby hook was nasty worki miss all these s graphicsshaq is so underrated mantwo giants battlingim surprised to see so many s takendamn looking at shaqs ft form if somebody just spent one preseason with him fixing it he could have so many scoring records that is some wonky ass two hand placement thereim a simple man when i see a post with hakeem i upvote that postthose kenny smith jumpers were butterthe league is so soft in todays game and im not mad about it just disappointedso disappointing to see them battle like that and have to come back to watch the modern league where theyd be flopping like crazy running the same schemesdream stole shaqs ring and no one will convince me otherwisethe closest sweep of all timeshaq was only here crazyjust an all time specimen in any sportsucks this series was a sweeporlando never recovered from this opening loss they got hakeem in foul trouble in the first half and built a point lead in late second quarter just much closer to insurmountable back in those days and thats before you get into how anderson just needed to make one free throw and smith had a hit a three to send into ot hakeemshaq never got close to playing another playoff series in their primes was kind of close hakeem was allnba first team unquestionably his last year as a top player in the league and shaq was all nba second team they would have met in the wcf if the lakers had beaten the jazz in the wcsfand yeah then you have first round where shaq dominated a hakeem who made allnba third teamhakeem is years older than shaq something that is often overlooked when people bring up that he dominated shaq in this serieswould have loved to see how hakeem dealt with lakers shaqyeah people act like kenny smith was a complete bum in the nba he was a very solid role player the skyhook is nowadays vanished but its really unstoppable if masteredi really hope it comes back that and centre big man duelshakeem and shaq with modern spacing on offense qouldve been ridiculous i think both couldve neared jokic assist numbers in the right systemsnone of those were skyhooks just regular hook shots or jump hooksa skyhook is where you jump and then flick the ball with your wrist at the apex from a fully extended arm only kaj does the skyhooksometimes ill load up k and do a myplayer like shaqand he didnt spill one drop of water when hakeem asked for a cupi always start the game with the move he pulled on david robinson and it always send the defender and i get an easy bucket only works once tho after that they sit on it to not get embarrassedthe offensive moves have changed imo way less hook shot ability by the majority of bigs and smaller bag of post moves and footwork ability this clip is two of the absolute best ever but the s in general just had more bigs with a bigger bag of moves at their disposal do many bigs these days not get to show it i think thats happening too but i dont think theres a lot of guys capable of being a focal point for long stretches even with the right circumstances s saw more entry pass denial on the perimeter and entry pass ability was very highly valued as a result i think theres also something to be said for the fitness of shaq and hakeem in this clip they ran down and claimed their ground fast showed and demanded that entry pass and it was so immediate within the possession that there was less of a chance for a denial part of what makes shaq so unstoppable is that very few teams were ever able to stop him from getting to the low block immediately within a possession shaq has spoken on many of the modern bigs not showing and creating a target early and often which is true but also just by design due to that not being a priority now and them not being lb super athletesthe difference is in the nba rules back then if defenses were going to double team players had to commit to it fully zone defense was illegal thats why defenders had to wait until the big man went into his move they were timing it to contest the shot double too early and the big man just passes to the man you left openthe difference is spacingdraymond touched on this before when talking about guarding shaq modern defenses would have focused on entry pass denial more than they did back then and once he finally got the ball the double would have been immediatethe funny thing is seattle always had their number for whatever reasonmen vs boysthe lob with left is so filthyskill vs brute forcenot many people remember but everyone had the magic winning this series back then they had just beaten the jordan bulls which many people also choose to ignore and were basically the hottest team in the league i was just a kid as well but all my older brothers were convinced shaq and penny were going to destroy hakeemshaq doesnt get enough credit for beating the bulls back then because all jordan defenders said he needed time to adjust even tho he was still mj when he came back what really put the bulls back on the map were the moves they made to put more pieces around jordan after that series and then the magic having so many key injuries the following yearat the time many teams would refuse to put their best player on hakeem they would put another big on him just for their star player to save energy thats why shaq wasnt actually guarding hakeem in many of his buckets you can hear more about this strategy when you look up rodmans book about spurs and how the league guarded hakeem in his primethis is the one of the big things shaq is talking about when he talks about big men todaycenters got down court early in the offensive sets back then because teams took their time getting the ball up they also just dont teach that any more shaq would just bulldoze down the court and go stand in his spot you werent going to push him off that spot lolwell you try to push shaq outs basketball was pretty top tier early s i think was the most but now is easily the most talented era old headshaq in the finals is up there for most dominant performance in a series ever ppg at fgnot that its fair but its a style thing for me he could just lower his shoulder and knock the defender over and there was never a call it was very frustrating to watchshaq is literally in the hall of fameshaqs not even th just taking centers into accounti have him th behind kareem wilt russell and olajuwon at no point did shaq match any of those above him on defenseshaq way better career than magic better peak and longevitybirthed the double decker taco hakeem and shaq and evolved into the quesorito jokic in a game sweep is just an ass beating wasnt on shaq but hakeem did cook their assesif you watched that video and think that game was more physical than this years playoffs you dont have working eyeshow soif shaq had got this ring it wouldve been an all time ringhim and penny were only hakeem and drexler was and long overduewhat does this even mean it was a sweepwut shaq got fuckin swepttim duncan got his first chip when he was wildhe looks so good with his young but still incredibly muscular bodyi mean thats a big if those jazz teams owned the lakers shaqs biggest weakness was on the pick and roll and they exploited the fuck out of thatthe next year the magic got swept by the bulls in the ecf game of that series the bulls played full court defense the entire nd half they took the magics soul that game they exposed the magics lack of ball handling and shaq left for la the next year i think their inability to get him the ball was a big factor in him leavingborderline all star in at least one season maybe two not a bum by any meanswemby would break the league if he masters thatshaq was an underrated passer through and through his time in miami proves ithell nahthey were good passers for big men but jokic an is all time great passer not just as a big man but period there is a huge gap thereand with modern travel rules as proven by both travels called in this videoi kind of feel the opposite there is a reason there are so few players that rely on post ups today defenses have a lot more freedom than they did back then teams now can pack the paint and make entry passes more difficult i would love to see hakeem free on defense he would be an absolute terror in todays nba a taller more athletic draymond greeni love hakeem but his giant glaring weakness until he was older was his passing he would not be putting anything near jokic assist numbersshaq wouldnt either but he was an underrated passerthey already had artificial spacing with the illegal defense rule can have higher numbers in the right systems its about if its effective or not obviously its too jokics credit when other all time bigs are compared to him but we need to chill jokics ability to read the game aint rare its straight up mythical hes the only player ive seen that seems to have the ability to see a couple of seconds into the futurelol nothank you these arent really even full hooks like you said jump hooks or baby hooks are the terms a hook shot typically means your body stays perpendiculr the jumpbaby hooks all these guys have rotate their body to face the hoop by the end of the motionthe thing about a lot of these moves is the open andor layup is worth more so if you think about it from a game theory and competitive standpoint it has a lower ceilingshaq wasnt easy to front he could push you away from the basket and was so massive and athletic that the guards could then just lob it over the defensethats what they did with shaq as well teams knew they didnt have a chance once shaq had the ball down low so they really needed to deny him the ball or foul him hence hack a shaq the problem was that shaq was really fucking good at establishing position quickly which was one of his most underrated aspects especially lakers shaq he also was surpisingly effective from midpost so you had to deny him further than expectedft omitted out of respect yep his game was fucking gross charge after charge after charge elbows that were never calledhe got away with plenty of charges but all teams got away with fouling the shit out of him too he took a massive amount of punishment and if they had called all of them every opposing team would have had players on the courti recall shaq erasing the interior offense one man lanes all clogged he didnt have the same numbers but i think thats a little of the wemby effect where guys just stopped trying to shoot near himwhy would shaq have to match russell on defense if russell couldnt match shaq on offense theres a night and day difference between their offensive games much larger than the defensive gap kareem and wilt could so its fair to have them above himplus his abysmal fts mar his game considerablythis is comical you never watched magic play cause if you had statements like this would never even cross your mindmy god you stats dorks will say anything after spending mins reading a stat linelil penny too rightand shaq had more blocks and fg vs hakeems so did shaq cook his ass toolmao the difference is its foul baiting and calls for love taps nowadays it was more physical back then a whole different gameagreedan unfair sweepit was unfaireasy nowmalone dominated shaqthriving in the triangle also proves it he was an incredibly smart player and its overlooked because of how physically dominant he wasi believe the argument being made is that their offensive gravity would make up for being worse passersshaq averaged close to assists in when the corner didnt exist its a mentality thing hes score st and jokic pass first but modern era on the right team shaq couldve averaged or i believewhat rule change gives defense more freedoma layup is worth the same amount of points as a hook shot and the degree of difficulty isnt all that different considering what it takes to give yourself an open lane and look at the rim vs the skill for a hook shot bigs that train on it can hit over of those easy which is in line with the layup percentages in the nba and the outlier hyper efficient guys like joker match the stupid numbers that curry did at the rim at his peak great footwork and post moves generates a layup or dunk which is again the same expected value as any other attempt at the rim in a vacuum and arguably more due to the higher likelihood of forced fouls and opening up shootersit was literally against the rules to help from the weakside before the pass if they wanted shaq to post up v they got it by rule if they put guys over on the weaksidewe all have our weaknesses lolmagic played in an easier league on way better teams shaq still accomplished much moreyeah the talent for those nike commercials were like mini moviesi would never claim that hakeem cooked shaq but he did have the better seriesdespite having fewer blocks as you said hakeem was easily the superior defensive force he knew he was at a size disadvantage against shaq so he relied on positioning and patience to take charges and swipe low for steals instead of jumping to contest every shot shaq turned the ball over times per game nearly twice as much as he did during the rest of that playoff run it was the single worst playoff series in terms of turnovers in his entire career by a decent marginnobody cooked anybody but shaq himself has said over a dozen interviews that he was not ready for that series because they were out partying too much after they beat the jordan bulls shaq took hakeem too lightly in that series and it showed because hakeem did play better overallplayoff physical defense give me the time stamp in this highlight video that looks anything remotely similar to my example videoin what sensehard nowive had this argument so many timesso many people think shaq was some lumbering dumb idiothe was an incredibly skilled and intelligent basketball playerwhile jokic being an excellent passer makes up for being a worse post playerhes not a bad post player per se in fact hes actually really good but nowhere near shaqs level much less hakeemscouldve sure wouldve prob not thats like saying giannis could be an assist leader sure but thats not what their game actually isbefore zone defenses werent allowed and there were strict rules about double teams you could not double team someone until they had the ballthe defense is lined up like this because of illegal defense rules the defender on the ball could go help on hakeem penny could also help but the offensive player can go to the weak side of the court to risk an illegal defense callopen layupyep defenses cant load preemptively if majority of the offense is in the other side its how so many teams back then got away with none pt shooting players illegal difference rule was basically league mandated spacing so it can show case isobro i dont need to watch a video i watched the games growing up they have literally changed the rules etc teams shoot s a game now including centers and big men todays nba is absolutely nothing like the s or s where you had multiple positions posting up and rarely shot s it was an inside out game its literally the opposite nowhe broke shaqits because he built his reputation on being a physically dominant player but like you said he was skilled especially for his size what made him dominant wasnt just his size and phyical strength but his touch and skillset that he had while being that big and strong i think phil said the lakers version of the triangle was his ideal version because of having a big who can pass like shaq gave him so many options and made the offense unpredictablehes not a bad post player per se in fact hes actually really good but nowhere near shaqs level much less hakeemsi think youre underselling how good jokic is in the post his level of touch is superhumanjokic in the post is the most efficient shot in the last yearscouldve neared jokic assists numbers i didnt say assist leadergiannis averaged giannis can definitely get up to if he was surrounded by right talentits objectively hard to argue with someone who has a thunder flair about this particular topicthat team got away with murder this season and probably will continue to do so for a whilei implore you to watch some games again i went back and watched some old games from the s when i remember being way more physical outside of bill lambeer with stupid hard fouls that shit looked way softer i was watching the final with my blazers against the bulls players seemed to never attempt to deny jordan off the ball and giving him plenty of space to just pull up and shoot it seemed really laid back and lax compare that with the hard fought shots i saw all playoffs this year and i had to really reevaluate what i thought of as tougher basketballthat has nothing to do with physicality the post ups now are more physical they dont happen as often because they arent efficient a post up with players standing around isnt physical basketball watch off ball players move nowand you obviously cant show where the game was more physical because the two videos are completely different levels of physicalityso he didnt steal anything dream took what was rightfully hisanyone that watches shaq highlights and doesnt see his skills must be blind you dont move your feet that well with those post moves by having no skillshave we seen him face the defense the old big men faced his touch is super good yes but we really havent seen big men get challenged at the rim these daysim not thats why i said hes really good in the post but he isnt on shaqs or hakeems level thoughi understand that and i agreestill not as good as shaqs and hakeems though which was my pointkudos to you for not just assuming without watchingi think he meant more physical back then as in players were allowed to maul each other lolthe players today are way better athletes so it makes sense the intensity is higheryou say the same about kd in i think its a matter of not seeing much of his highlights on this sub all anyone sees is clips of him on inside and podcasts talking shithe was shooting all over ad in the playoffs so kinda but obviously not as consistently as the s guys when there were more defensive focused big menshaq is close but jokic scores more and is more efficient in the post than hakeem add the passing threat and its tough to argue otherwise imothere were a few more insanely hard cheap fouls thats not a physical game its not that its that peoples brains cant comprehend that the league is more physical now because theyve listened to people who dont watch the sport now',\n",

something pretty cool to learn that he eventually became a rancherwow what a pullangry upvote the vast majority of the country was like that back then it wasnt just a boston thing russell started playing in the civil rights movement didnt even end until russell was the best player in a predominantly white sports league during the entirety of the civil rights era unfortunately life was going to be hell for him anywhereif you read even russells wikipedia page youll find examples of his parents having shotguns shoved in their face in louisiana russell his black teammates being denied hotel rooms in north carolina and being refused service at a restaurant in kentucky while playing for the celtics its disingenuous historical revisionism to try to act like russell only faced racism in boston or that all of america wasnt undergoing the civil rights movementits true boston was famously the only city in america with racismi mean yes but its not like the rest of america was some postracial paradise in the si think he probably wouldve had a really bad time playing somewhere else as wellyall were still racist when he played on the road too lets talk about it thenyou see boston is historically one of the most progressive cities it was the hub of the abolition movement massachusetts was the first state to legally ban slavery nd state to repeal ban on interacial marriage massachusetts also had lack of sundown towns that excluded black peopleplaces like californiany and midwesternsouthern states had lots of them or kkkwhite supremacist chaptersplaces in the south had lots of them too it didnt have formal jim crow lawsthe massachusetts racial imbalance act enacted in was the first state law in the us to directly address racial imbalance in public schoolsboston had the metropolitan council for educational opportunity metco established in was the first voluntary school desegregation programduring the great migration many african americans fled to boston for a better quality of life to escape from racismso how did boston recieve this reputation of being racist while being a historically progressive citylet me provide some historical contextduring the late th century the busing crisis was the turning point which stained bostons reputation even though other cities were also going through racial tensions it was extensively covered by the national media we all saw the soiling of old glory photo although other cities were also going through racial tensions like boston southern politicianssegregationists used this crisis as ammo for propaganda to whatabout the city of boston a huge reason for this is because they wanted to keep racist jim crowsboston is now used as a scapegoat for nothern racism despite what other cities were going through at

russelland those are the good playersthere were as many dahntay jones back then as well just end of bench guys ready to rock when necessaryyou got it wrong guys like laimbeer oakley werent pests like we have today they didnt fail around and kick people in the nuts and work the refs non stop like teenage girls they were the enforcers you mess with isaiah or starks and then they came after you otherwise they were playing hardnosed basketball and took as much as they gaveshit draymond isnt even an enforcer teams mug steph and he does nothingbruce bowen is actually when the league stopped on court justice and tried to bring it in house the result is you got little snake bitches like him trying to break ankleswhich still made him significantly wealthier than average and certainly wealthy enough to avoid daytoday financial stress so long as he wasnt dumb with that moneydo you think every league instantly goes to billion dollar powerhouse lol look at wnba salariesthe league didnt make money when he playedits be much weirder if he made millions back then when there wasnt even millions to give himits like the wnba players wondering why their salaries are so low its because they dont make much moneyactually it is the current salaries in the nba compared to doctors that is crazy but we like to be amusedits not insane at all actually absurd that you think that he should be making modern day wall street associate money back in the sthe league big enough now that players like this should get an honorary mil or something tbhmakes sense considering the size of the audience for the league back then compared to nowdraftees were turning down contracts to work a trade instead lmaowell back then basketball was not as big so the nba back then is more like what you would pay for the star table tennis league today or somethinghonestly thats how it should be athletes are over paid as shitusa general practicioners make fucking k dollarsdefinitely not the best basketball player of his era thoughim at work gimme a break ah biscuitsfrom his wiki kaman claims he decided to enter the nba draft a year early so he could fund a chicken farm in his home state of michiganim guessing hes more of a money man than the guy out in the field shoveling shitnothing cool about participating in the inhumane agriculture industryhim and theo pinson are probably the goat towel wavers at the end of the benchthe first black to play in the sec was in what is bostons excuse nowits low hanging fruit people are too lazy to actually do research and read so theyll just take the easy routei think when people talk about bostons history of racism in respect to the celtics is more framed as boston was notorious for its treatment of black people in relation to other northern and especially east coast citiesno but theres a reason he moved to seattle after he retired and didnt return to boston for decades he should have been a local legendcan confirm but hey we got the best clam chowda in the worlda true celtics fan would know betteroften during road games russell and his black teammates would hear racial slurs from opposing fans and they would not be allowed to stay in the same hotels or eat in the same restaurants as white teammatespeople single out boston but thats because bill played there it was just as bad or worse in other cities most cities couldnt even draft a black player since they were too racistas someone knowledgable about us history philly chicago nyc la etc were all going through some shit as wellwhy are you saying yall i doubt of this sub was even alive when russell playedremovedso how is modern boston compared to busing era bostoneven though boston had a predominantly black population back in the s it had a large white population as well but since the sboston has become one of the most diverse cities in america in it had theth highest diversity index us census bureau datathe diversity index grew by since the s it has a black population percentage for reference nycs is las is around sfs is around san francisco gentrified most their black people outmeaning in people you meet in boston is going to be black and this isnt even looking at greater boston which has seen a large increase of black residents increase in it was thethmost ethnically diverse major city in america it has a very diverse black population and it is only getting more diversein boston public schools kids are nonwhiteit is a immigrant sanctuary and so that allows people the from caribbeanmy parents are from there african and south america countries to come here of all black residents in greater boston are foreign born which is nearly x the national average it has one of the highest net mirgation from foreign born black citizens you will see a lot of cape verdeans dominicans haitians brazilians etcblack boston is powerful and thriving first state with black senator second state with black governor has a black ag and a black supreme court chief justice it had the first local branch of the naacp a person from boston founded naacp boston naacp has the most active chapters in the country it has the highest conentration of collegeeducated black people in the usth best city where black people thrive incities with biggest income racial gapboston was not in this list that included nyc atl dallas etcone of the best cities for black womenblack in the boston metro have the highest median incomes of any city outside of washington dc black students in massachusetts perform as the best in the country in educationread to next commentborn to pursue interests and be silly forced to lock in and get shit donedont give them any ideasanother old school gem was willis reed fighting the entire lakers squad all by himself up to the comment i replied to genius its some sloppy ball and they launch a lot of air balls but they play scrappyirony is he and draymond had a bit of beeflaimbeer wasnt an enforcer he was an antagonizer he was good at it but i dont remember him doing or having to do much in the realm of protecting his teammatesno youve got it wrong very wrongguys like laimbeer were aiming to injure from the tipoff they werent pests no they were just out and out no bones made trying to take the other teams players out of the gamethere were enforcers yes and then there were players many players whose dirtiness simply has no modern equivalent because if you tried it today youd get run out of the whole leaguei grew up watching laimbeer dude did all the things youre talking about working the refs antagonizing other playersthomas also was an irritant too thats how they played they tried to break other teams mentally by getting under their skin as much as possiblethat first round exit still hurts that bad ehits just crazy to think about because any random no name bench player that never gets minutes is making significantly more in todays nbawell the wnba as an entertainment business simply isnt very interesting high school basketball is more entertainingdoctors in almost every other country get paid way less than doctors here in part because most other developed countries have socialized medicinedid you really not read the part of ops comment where he said that the k was inflationadjustedalso im not sure you understand what an associate is it is onestep up from entry level ie the first promotion for people hired out of undergrad and entry level for mba grads theyre mostly years oldthe league generates a ton of money if the players make less where does that extra money go you think the owners are going to donate it to charityare they though its a multi billion dollar industry i dont see why they shouldnt be making a shitload of money if they were boring shitty ass players the industry would not be making that kind of money just look at the wnbathey arent overpaid by any sense of the word they create so much value for these leagues and only get a portion of the revenue from it the money they make from actually playing the game is given voluntarily by fans advertising agencies and tv providers its not like theyre nestle type capitalists stealing water from african children or something the people complaining about player salaries simply dont like that the numbers are big and reductively think all wealth is evil they should unironically get paid even moreno theyre not lol if anything the star players are underpaid compare the extra revenue that lebron brought to his various franchises vs what his actual salary wasoh yes and specialists make k plus at leastget out of here monster we work hard for our money in this house and we dont give it awaythe nba was merely a stepping stone for him i love thatmark madsen would like a wordlmaooexcuse for what stop believing circlejerk memes so muchevery single city has plenty of jackasses that will do and say horrible things but boston probably actually has a lot less than most these daysthe celtics themselves were radically progressive at the time they were the first nba franchise to draft a black player the first team with an all black starting and hired the first black head coachboston was notorious for its treatment of black people in relation to other northern and especially east coast citiesthis is wild to say boston got its racist reputation from the busing crisis and bill russell incidentsmeanwhile in nyc and phillyactual riots that boston didnt have philly had one of the first major northern race riots of the civil rights era antiblack policing and discrimination caused it they also had the move bombing which killed african americans and destroyed residential homes nyc had the harlem riot which the city abondened its black community nypd was notorious for violence in black and hispanic neighborhoods heavily redlinned neighborhoods etc landlords openly refused black tenantswilt literally said he faced so much racism playing in phillythe idea that boston was a uniquely racist nothern city during the time is just super uneducatedboston in relation to other cities during bill russells timeuntil the late s bostons jazz scene offered an escape for new york musicians and artists fleeing nyc racist cabaret lawsthe lakers were an allwhite team playing in minnesota later in los angeles black students were protesting against a whitesonly neighborhood only to be met withnazi and kkk counterprotesterssouthern cites excluded black people from their racist instituions due to jim crow laws abolitionists from massachusetts funded the existence of hbcus massachusetts was the first state to legally ban slavery it also had a lack of sundown towns compared to other statesmlk went to school in boston where he became the activist he was boston is still the leader of black educationa person from boston founded the naacp a person who grew up from boston helped cultivate the culture of harlemfirst black senatorfirst voluntary citysuburb desegregation program metcoonly state to reelect a black governordeval patrickst louis for example had a chance to draft bill russell but the city was too racist philly cincinnati detroit were other cities with entrenched racism stars like wilt chamberlain and other black players spoke about being treated like second class citizens or worse in those citiesboth philly and nyc had race riots in this time period in weeks apart from eachother harlem riot of and columbia avenue race riot boston has no full blown riots but it did have racial tensions and the busing crisiswilt literally tried to buy a house in san franciscos golden gate heights neighborhood the developer who refused to sell chamberlain the house told the chronicle i feel interracial mixing of neighborhoods devalues property negroes tend not to have enough money frankly as a group i cant say i like them very much but individually i like thempretty sure it means white peopleyeah i guess you guys were probably preoccupied by killing indigenous kids and burying them in mass unmarked graves in that caseits bigger than the flair doofus boston is doing better than most cities in racial metricssegeration hate groups hate crimes black wealth sdg ranking etc compared to other cities like la nyc philly detriot milwaukee etc for example i went on the slc hate map andboston itself has antiblackwhite supremecist groupsslc hate map datawhile places like la nyc florida texas are thriving with themit is also not even the th most segregated city in americait isnt not even top th in cities with most hate crimes it ranked topth in most socially equitable cities in the usa with a equality ratinglowest incercation rate for black people etcboston has been a liberal stronghold for decades i have said it is a immigrant sanctuary state meaning that it serves protection to immigrants it isone of the most immigrant friendliest cities i mean it was the first to legalize samesex mirrage and is a hub for lgbtq rights massachusetts was the first state to achieve near universal healthcarehealthcare for people of all colors massachusetts was one of the few states if only white people voted it would remain blue every county even the rural areas was blue last electionthe last time a white supremecist group rallied in bostona few dozen people it got drowned out by s of progressive bostoniansremember the naacp has declared florida unsafe for black and lgbtq people texas is still printing out books that are trying to justifiy slavery nyc and cali have their fair share of racist hate groups dont forget about the statues of racist confederate generals the south still has a lot of states still have active kkk chapters they celebrate robert e lee day in alabama mississippi tennessee and florida racism is everywherenot providing a tldr just read the damn thing thanksi dont care about the air balls as much as the dangerous unsportsmanlike fouls theyve normalized cheap shots that people should get ejections and suspensions forthere are good players in that league but some of them get assaulted too much to shinelol yep thats what reminded me of him james johnson who used to be very serviceable is now riding benches because of his vet leadership and dontfuckarounditisso eager to get your wnba hot take out you let the point sail right over your headand youre saying that people didnt feel the same way about the nba back during bill russells day if he was making such a moderate amount lmaotaxes and social nets charity is just another way the rich avoid taxes we need to tax them and set up social safety nets for the rest of societythat money would be put to better use if they sent it to some these poor communities that a lot of these athletes come from no one should get an infinity pool or sports cars while people still go hungry for lack of money there is only so much cash to go around and if we make more millionaires and billionaires then we also make more poverty thats why poverty is necessary for a capitalist system to function and why capitalism is always evil it demands suffering and overpaying these athletes is a small part of that problemthe biggest stars should be paid way more if we stick to capitalistic principles but unchecked capitalism is pretty evilthose are absolutely absurd entrylow end salaries even adjusted to living costs and different countries median incomes for doctors compared to honestly anywhere else but usaberkeley lists boston as a high segregated city new aged racists are just better at hiding it now and most interviews with those actual players including russell speak to how different their experiences were between the org and their day to day personal lives living in the cityno one is arguing red was racist it was the attitude ingrained in most of the population that was the issueabsolutely theres a reason that many members of the organization were present for russells first jersey retirement ceremony but theres a reason he requested no celtics fans be presentamericans arent really renowned for their treatment of indigenous people eitherthose were the churches the catholic church did that to my grandmother kick rocksboston is a flea market of racism bill russell in his book second windyou can literally just quote the guyplayers are hitting the deck right and left but im impressed by how quick they get right back up if play isnt stoppedgeez i didnt even realize he was still in the leaguetheyre nothing if not determined to let you know that women arent good people and dont deserve to be paidnope the point is that the nba was an entertaining business that took a long time for salaries to increase so much the nba is the best of the best as far as basketball quality the wnba is simply an inferior product that is less interesting than a decent hs basketball game ive watched the stars the playoffs its simply not that great thats why the salaries suck also business wise having worked and managed hundreds of millions in sales if were losing money people will be cut and not make a lot they still should be paid more but up until the last few years the wnba revenue has been tinyhe was making way more than what the majority of wnba players make today and they are only still existing because the nba carries them they lose money every year and never generate any profit even though they have the advantage of social media and the internet for exposure and marketing something the nba didnt have in the s and syeah sure that would be the ideal situation and would benefit the majority of people too bad billionaires dont give a shit they didnt get their fortune by being generous or caring about the average americans quality of lifethe billionaire owners should be the ones being taxed to hell but even if that was the case do you trust the government to actually use the taxes to genuinely better society for the majority of peoplethats not the reality of the situation though if that money doesnt go to the players it would be going to the billionaire owners insteadliterally in the link you provided boston is lower than most nba cities including chicago nyc detriot milwaukee atlanta bay area miami dallaswhere you livealso they provided

warmthits almost like anyone using this low hanging fruit line of argument is being disingenuous and ignoring the skeletons in their own closets people using real issues to get jokes off and acting like theyre superior when the same things can be said about them and where theyre from in of casesyes were all aware of that it was just a those in glass houses shouldnt throw stones situationin in the same interview he referred to the city as a flea market of racism still russell recognized that bostons problems with race were not unique sourceoften during road games russell and his black teammates would hear racial slurs from opposing fans and they would not be allowed to stay in the same hotels or eat in the same restaurants as white teammates sourcein a interview on gbhs basic black russell saidi think you would find the situation the same in every major citywe can explain what was happening in other major cities like nyc chicago la and even minnesota if youd likehere we go with the beta simpin its a fact that the wnba brings in no revenue and without the nba would not exist anymore they cant stand on their own two feet and when they finally have a talent that people care about most of the women in the league are hating on her envy pettiness and even racismits almost like one has a signifcantly longer history and exposure leading to better development of talent and engagement and one wasnt made until checks notes and has to fight against shit like dudes like you who immediately compare them to men to feel better about themselves in their daily liveslmao so fucking what the fact of the matter is still that the nba wasnt a fucking broadcastmoneysports powerhouse the way it is today ever hear of the aba nba owners had thin fucking margins and the players were paid accordingly back in the day wnba players had the exact same shit happen to them except their margins were worse negative and thus they were also paid worse do yall braindead nephews seriously not realize when youre making the exact same point i am lmaooopeople just didnt care for basketball back thenjust because that isnt the way it is doesnt mean we cant make it the way it is we could i dont know tax the rich maybe like at alljust because i live here doesnt mean i will blindly believe we arent racist our ag is suing dallas suburbs because he doesnt like how many indians are moving here and we are gerrymandering the entire state to wipe out all but democratic congressional seat but everyone knows how troubled dallas and texas is but turn a blind eye to any racism above the masondixon linethat is a good question this pages lays it out since racial composition racial demographics and even racial diversity itself are not the same thing as racial segregation which represents the degree of residential separation and distance between members of different racial groups not only does our map directly show racial residential segregation itself indicating the level of segregation in every neighborhood in the united states as well as indicating the racial composition of that tract it does this for every major measure of segregationand yes most cities are still pretty racistdid i say dallas wasnt racist our ag is sueing neighborhoods because too many indians are moving in while we are also gerrymandering our entire state to wipe out all but democractic congressional seat i dont think racism is a joke but if you do than you fit right in with bostonthis is about russells experiences in boston he called it a flea market of racism specified it was the first retirement ceremony and the fact that russell specifically requested that no fans be in attendance is relevant to a discussion of his experiences with fans while he was a player stop being obtuse no one is accusing any specific celtics fan in this thread of being racist yall dont have to do this bill russell himself called boston a flea market of racism whataboutismtheres a reason he got the hell out after his career was overlol here we go with the lack of selfawareness and a dysfunctional relationship with women im sure it doesnt matter that it took the nba years to become profitable because chromosomes or somethinglook i get you are in your emotions about this but its not entertaining to watch because the game is played at such a lower level in pro leagues youre watching the best athletes in the world whereas with the wnba just just watching the best women in the world not the best athletes its a completely different business model it wont matter in years the wnba will never be as big as the nba because its simply not the best athletes in their sportsame era that the ufc was formed and yet one became a profitable business and the other is still depending on the nba for assistance while acting entitled and delusional and remember mma was viewed as human cockfighting for a long time and the organizations had to do a lot to prove it was a real sport that deserved to be sanctionedbecause it was still mostly white accountants playing the game the right wayhow is that in any way mutually exclusive with athletes making big moneyokay but that wouldnt change their base salariesyou seem more concerned about what the athletes are making than the actual evil billionaires that own the teams lolyoure right that we need to tax the rich more but that wouldnt magically make the players contracts smaller lolthis doesnt dismiss the actual metrics and statistcs provided here the idea that boston was uniquely racist during bills era is absurb and super uneducatedin in the same interview he referred to the city as a flea market of racism still russell recognized that bostons problems with racewere not unique sourceoften during road games russell and his black teammates would hear racial slurs from opposing fans and they would not be allowed to stay in the same hotels or eat in the same restaurants as white teammates sourcein a interviewon gbhsbasic black russell saidi think you would find the situation the samein every major citywe can explain what was happening in other major cities like nyc chicago la etc if youd likei literally responded to someone else who used this same quote the point of contention here was that other major cities had as much racial tension and it wasnt unique to bostonin in the same interview he referred to the city as a flea market of racism still russell recognized that bostons problems with racewere not unique sourceoften during road games russell and his black teammates would hear racial slurs from opposing fans and they would not be allowed to stay in the same hotels or eat in the same restaurants as white teammates sourcein a interviewon gbhsbasic black russell saidi think you would find the situation the samein every major citywe can explain what was happening in other major cities like nyc chicago la etc if youd likeso its whataboutism when the whole original arugment here was that bostons problem wasnt unique or that it shouldnt be singled out youre basically using a buzzword to dodge the discussion herelets be real you probably havent read my essay above because you have some internal biasesin the quotes i provided above bill indicated that boston shared this problem with many other cities during his era it is absurb to use this as a lowhanging fruit as a common rhetoric to mock celtics fans especially if youre a nonwhite bostonian lmao perhaps you should have an open mind when a black bostonian is speaking on the mattersometimes the circlejerk goes too faryeah and during that period the nba players salary adjusted for inflation was less than the wnba players salary and didnt have nearly the entertainment desperate market that we have todaylets put it this way if the roles were flipped and the wnba was the premiere league would you watch itreal gym ratsnah but you dont understand women arent good people and dont deserve to get paid and if you think differently its because you want women to like you did i do it rightdont bother with these bots and trollsyoure trying to push a sexism angle that doesnt hold lol at some point ronda rousey was the biggest star in the ufc even though it was over the top marketing that became ridiculous but it showed that if the product is interesting people will watch and dont tell me that it was mostly women buying all those ppvsno one is saying that the fact that that is the argument you are making proves you have no legitimate point womens basketball just isnt as entertaining ive tried a lot to watch it but i cant the argument shouldnt be basketball it should be soccer womens soccer is entertaining and far more talented than mens they bring in far more money than mens yet get paid less for the national team playersi mean they only deserve to get paid according to the profit they generate its not like theyre performing a public service',\n",
       " 'fuck rob mahoney zach lowe and the nba consensusthere are different reasons to double team he may be wrong on cam thomas but he definitely isnt wrong about double teaming because youre not going to pass they also double team some players because they cant play under pressure and not to get the ball out of their hands young kd was always fumbling under double teamsyou guys are kinda ragging on this take and i understand the counterpoint but it would not surprise me at all if nba coaches discuss robs point why wouldnt a players ability to effectively pass out of a a double team impact a teams decision to double team that person if they can make the right play every time out of the double team and make you pay you might be more inclined to take your chances with more traditional defense everyone is shitting on the take but why wouldnt that ability be part of the equationif a player just gives the ball up when theyre doubled or eats it then thats a win for the defense if the player consistently makes the right read out of the double and makes the defense pay they wont be doubled as oftenhave yall never watched cam thomas beforeeverybody knows cam thomas wont pass and thats why hes getting doubled why is everyone acting so aloofits wild how many defenders chuck and pray thomas has on reddit lmaohes rightyourerob mahoney bringing out the flamethrowerrandle is a great example of a guy that got doubled a lot as the first option on the knicks it was simply the best play because he was not good at dealing with them however getting doubled a lot the will to improve eventually made him very good at handling doubles as a result he sees them less is better at producing out of them and can tear people apart in man coverageso cam gets doubled ok that just provides the opportunity to handle them better also hes getting doubled for a good reasoni havent watched a lot of cam so i dont know if this assessment is right but rob is right that some players are doubled because they cant or wont pass again i dont know if cam is one of those playerssometimes players just dont have the ability to recognize the play others just have the belief that they can overcome the double and score regardless of the reason the double is not always a sign of respect for the offensive player from the defensecant believe rob mahoney doesnt know the difference between between your and yourerob mahoney for sure read the reddit threadi know a guy like cam thomas dude had an insane amount of confidence me against the world mentality and if you didnt unequivocally support him you were dead to him he believed he could move mountains he believed he was put on his earth to play football and anyone keeping him from it was the worst kind of human possible truly he believed that fast forward to college dude had a career altering injury lisfranc and his own coach said he was damaged goods went from a nd rounder to being undrafted he became a shell of himself and quit his injury healed actuallybut not getting drafted ruined his entire sense of self his whole motivation and mental model he now believes every past critique of him is true hes a fraud and lives in absolute misery completely losing his self belief its insane but when i saw last dance and how michael jordan would take everything personally and i think about my friends example its crazy how much needing to maintain that crazy level of confidence is important for these athletes and how the margin for error is so smalli get this take but who on the nets should he have been passing toand also his teammates are keon johnson nic claxton jalen wilson and noah clowney but well ignore that partwhy would i not double team the guy that can score any given night when nobody else on the team can even shootgeez is this gang up on cam thomas week what tf did he do so bad its guys that committed felonies that dont get this much flakdeletedeh he said it in a bad waybut its true of any double team were gonna double you because we think our chances of your team scoring are less on that single possession if we do than if we dont sometimes that might mean we think youre not good enough at passing out of the double efficiently this might be true for cam and definitely has been true for a lot of inexperienced stars throughout nba history sometimes the might mean we think your teammates suck and wed rather give them an open shot than you a contested one think kobe and kwame brown or smush parker or it might mean youre so goodefficient at scoring we simply cant allow you to go v regardless of if you can pass out of it or not think jokic or shaqsometimes its a combo of all those thingscam thomas better take that mill because next year he might b looking at from a new teami mean is he wrongwhat makes me laugh the most about this is rob mahoney never has hot takes about anything hes mister lukewarmsometimes players get doubled because theyd rather force them to pass and make somebody else beat you not necessarily always due to not passingmoronic take classic zach lowe and associates stuffthey are likely get paid or trying to please buddybuddy relationship with nets fodoubleteamed because he is fin best scorer at that teami dont really care about cam thomas but this is a bad way to twist itthe comparisons to jordan clarkson are kinda disrespectful to the level of scorer cam is capable of being do people even watch jordan clarkson or are they just comparing cam to a th man scorer i think there are three main problems here is that hes perpetually injured so he never gets a rhythm the nets have no direction and they should have never drafted a scorer of his caliber with the direction they were trying to go as a team at the time because it stunted his development it was a head scratcher from jump the nets sucki agree with some of what was said but hes definitely capable of being a high level scorer on a competitive team as his consistency and passing continues to improve some players get grace to develop others dont he hasnt been in the league that long that i think his organization should give up on him due to him not being there yet but thats just my opinioni mean that is just not true at all some of the leagues top play makers are double teamed more than cam thomas is trae jokic and luka all constantly have to deal with doublesthat doesnt even make sensei thought the way lowe handled it was finegood but i dont like this sort of thing where it feels purposely antagonisticnah thats dumb he gets doubled because hes a good scorer on a team with bad offensive players its not that serious but people need their stupid narrativesthe reporters are double and triple teaming cam thomas not gonna lie lmao i been seeing his name pop up everywhere by all the podcast and reporters loli dont know who this man is but ive never seen anyone that looks and sounds like a podcaster more than this manhe was meticulously crafted by the hand of god to be a s podcasterit was a lot of fun to listen to this segment hope more nba players call zach outwhat a moronic takethese guys are dumbassesdumbest basketball take ive heard in a long timethese dumbasses again idk how it is your job to watch nba games and have no idea what youre talking about top playmakers are double teamed all the time if a player is double teamed its because they are a dangerous scorer on not because they dont pass like james harden was double teamed at mid court and hes one of the best playmakerscam gets doubled mostly because hes the best scorer on the netsam i crazy to think i should bet the over on cam thomas assists in the season opener as hell look to prove a point before going back to his normal self once the devil inevitably whispers in his earhe cant open the season with assists and fg attempts after all this surelyhe had literally fucking help besides johnson his team sucked why would he not take the shots if they are fallingrob is on so many podcasts that he always physically looks like hes being forced to do so many against his will like hes being kept awake to just do pod after podhow does a guy who doesnt pass average apgis he gonna change his name to rob mahwho is cam thomas supposed to pass to the nets roster is pure garbageprobably more so that when he gets double teamed he tends to hold on to the ball too long and ends up turning it over not a fan of jordan clarksons game either but if cam can get to that level which he has the talent for hes worth a roster spot on a good teamthese guys fucking suckthis is the heavily discounted version of lebronsas beefi thought zach lowe was fair on his assessment of cam this guy i know for certain has never watched a nets gamerob whoand if you down with them fuck you tooyeahone of kds big jumps to superstar level was when he got better at handling the double teams you dont need to be an amazing passer or anything he just got to a point where he could see them coming and didnt get flustered that was his leap to mvplevelafter watching the wcf finals this year i think the next jump in ants game is to get better with double teams hes okay when hes doubled but okc was constantly flustering him with a second defender to be fair to ant okc might be the most loaded defensive roster since the pistons so its not like other teams could throw a carusodort double at himyeah people are missing the point here mahoney is only pointing out the fallacy in cam thomas argument thomas argued i see a ton of doubles so therefore im greatmahoney is arguing you see a ton of doubles because its an effective scheme against you defenses might double a player because theyre great or they might double a player because the playerteam doesnt make plays that take advantage of the man thats left openits been the hardest part of cade cunninghams transition into the pros in his case he was catching doubles because no one else on the floor was a threat to even hit a shot so doubling cade wasnt a significant risk he struggled often when hed get blitzed on the perimeter wasnt really until last year that defenses finally had to respect a shooter or two and his game totally opened up having watched that all play out i think i do want to see cam thomas on an actually functional team before i make any declarations about what he is or isnt capable ofi think last season simons was top in most doublesblitz seen and it was solely because he was the only trailblazer player at the time who could do anything with the ball this past season it was less as other players improved offensivelyi remember herro years ago got doubled a ton because he was terrible at passing the ball couldnt read anything and would just turn the ball over now hes made himself into a slightly a lil more than that imo above average playmaker its all about weather cam continues that development to be a better playmaker because he came in a worse passer than herro coach cal had to tell herro to not pass the ball in college because bad things happened when he did and hasnt developed nearly the enough to be even consider a connector or ball moversome guys like steph and jokic its because even though they can make plays their scoring is too good to leave unhindered young kd was always fumbling under double teamshell even kd got slaughtered by the double team in the celtics nets seriesyes but they doubled kd teams arent doubling role players and nonscorers thats literally just a fact im sorry but cam being doubled is not a knock on him as a player at most it shows that the team around him was ass which it was and that cam is not as polished and advanced as a highusage guy yet i dont actually think teams double guys like cam thomas on bad teams because they wont pass its because theyre often the lone offensive production i dont recall cam being doubled and deciding to go v last season despite the narrative around him he is absolutely a capable playmakerits absolutely a major factor the top passers dont get double teamed much if at allneutral fans arent watching nets games lolwhen hes hot he can make any shot but its lots of pounding the rock and chucking it can be fun to watch but its never going to be winning basketballare you surprised he plays for one the least popular teams with an awful record and he missed of the seasoni watched him last season thought wow this guy is an absolute world class black hole and then i go on reddit and people talk about how improved his passing is what passingtheyve either tuned in to their team playing the nets and seen him get hot or theyre evaluating his game from a stat sheetbefore the allstar break the nets won of held opponents under points in out of the games and had the rated defense in the nba over that stretch guess who didnt dressin the games he played in we didnt hold opponents under points oncesincere question can you give me a ballpark number of how many nets games you watched last yearhis point was like a bunch of the top comments on the original threadagree with the first half but i dont think randle ever excelled against double team defense i honestly love him but part of what him infuriating to watch at times was not just the inability to pass out of double teams but the unwillingness to do so most times he would be in shooting motion against multiple defenders and in the air realize it would be a poor quality shot and then pass it off to anyone near him to get rid of the rock or hed hold hold hold until he put himself in trouble and turned it over talking about knicks randle btw i dont know how he fared with this in minnythe wide open guyi always laugh at how people think that nba players on tanking teams are like the equivalent of that one kid who got picked last in dodgeball theyre still fucking nba players they can score the ball if theyre wide open yeah theyre not like good players compared to most nba players but theyre still nba playerscam johnson is a very good catch and shoot guy they arent like the bobcats or something they had real nba playersthats the issue with evaluating how good he really is youre right that there wasnt a good option for him to pass to on the nets but id imagine teams with good options arent sure if he would make the pass if there was a good option on the nets we wont really know until we watch him play on a better team but i have no idea when that will happenlooking at the roster idk how they won more than gamesjonathan kuminga needs to go to the netscam johnson is thomas a better player than claxton probably not so he could pass to him a bit moreyou still make the right basketball playi know someone who is closely related to one of the nets players i will touch base on and off about how the player is doing last time we spoke she said he doesnt like cam because he is a ball hog lolyou forgot johnson schroeder from ctg he spent a big chunk of time with schroder and johnson on the court finnlysmith is decently ok too id rather be cam thomas than say herro postbutler tradewhen you have a meltdown like cam did saying fuck lowe in particular you open yourself up to a response do you believe cam should be allowed to say fuck you to a someone and is entitled to not get criticism back for it his response to lowes criticism was also just embarrassing prove them wrong stop making excuses like cam didwhat is going on are people really comparing cam thomas getting double teamed to luka and giannisits not a bad thing its just not inherently impressive either there is context around everythingthe difference is that its risky to double luka and giannis its not risky to double thomasluka is a great passer and giannis is basically unstoppableits not getting spun as a bad thing mahoneys just pointing out that getting doubled isnt inherently impressive two things can be true at the same time thomas got doubled a lot because hes the best offensive player on a bad team and teams felt very comfortable doubling thomas because they dont think hes going to pass is mahoneys point and its important context unless thomas improves hell always likely be a good statsbad team guy because even if he went to a good team as a third scoring option defenses would still double him because they dont think hes going to give up the ball imagine if he were on okc and taking contested shots while doubled while sga and jdub were on the floor hed get benched super quicklybecause luka and giannis turn those double teams into opportunities for the rest of their team and have both shown that they can be the best player on a championship level nba team the argument isnt that cam thomas getting doubleteamed is a bad thing its that cam thomas getting doubleteamed doesnt in any way refute the idea that hes a ballhogdid you just start paying attention to basketballhis point is that he doesnt take advantage of double teams but that is also something that can be changed is he willing to change that though its an attack on the way he chooses to play saying that it isnt conductive of winning he can change that but does he want to change that maybe this is a wakeup call for him or hell double down and continue the way he wants to playyea i agree i dont even like cam thomas but saying he is getting double teams because solely he cant or wont pass is very weird then that defensive strategy would be executed against alot of players around the league and you would wear out your players there is no way maybe in critical situations but not every player unwilling or unable to not be able to passin the case of the nets its more believable that cam thomas can generate alot of offense for them and if you double team him then its an easy win against the nets because they have no other alternatives but then lowe has to legitimize a player he labels as streaky which he is but shouldnt ignore his talent and he rather instead make some bad faith argument luka and giannis are in a different level so the comparison to them is not thereits talking head speak for cam thomas doesnt deserve to get double teamed so he must be a terrible team player this despite the fact that the narrative around the nets was they arent tanking right at all why are they trying so hardof they can force a bad shot from him while he is being doubledhow if a player cant effectively make the right read out of a double team why wouldnt that impact coaches decisions to double team someoneyou honestly think the nets made a mistake taking a guy who profiles as another lou williams with a pick in the s how many late first round picks from that draft even got a second contractthere can be different reasons to double team players obviously youre not double teaming those guys because you think they cant pass youre double teaming them because you want to force the ball out of their hands early in the possession you can still double team other people because they cant handle ball pressurewont pass out of it this changes the timing and scheme behind the double team but doesnt change the fact that you do double team the playerthere are multiple reasons a coach could want to double team someonebecause theyre such a scoring threat because there arent other scoring threats on the court because the player struggles with that pressure in the hopes to create turnoverswith cam its a little bit of multiple things the nets dont have other good scoring threats so the risk versus reward of doubling teaming him is higher especially if you know he wont pass out of it and you can significantly decrease his efficiency while being doubled they wouldnt be doubling him though if he wasnt a threat to scoresometimes and id argue its a lot of times with the higher end players like traelukajokic even old man harden that theyd rather just get the ball out of these guys hands as opposed to letting them get downhill and into the paint which is where basically all of those guys will absolutely wreck teamsi dont think any rational person thinks of cam thomas that waythis was on the lowe show in reference to cams comments earliercall zach out for what his lengthy take on cam thomas was wellbalanced and very reasonablei dont think you understand the layersany rationalesure but obviously coaches decisions to double team a player may also be influenced by how often that player makes the right reads out of a double team if the player just gives the ball up without making the defense pay then thats a win for the defense if the player actually makes the defense pay for doubling then they might not get doubled as oftenhe played with cam johnson dfs dennis schroder and nic claxton the nets still had a losing record when he was out theremaybe because they werent falling and shooting s per game isnt very goodchino xlsimilarly dame was talking about how jrue clamping him up in the playoffs motivated him to deal with traps and blitzes betterkd even still struggled a bit with double teams after that too i remember during that nd celtics nets series the celtics kept sending double teams at him but theyd never do it the same way the kept changing where and when the help was coming and it completely threw him off his game turnovers bad shots grenades to teammates etci cant even blame kd that much though that team didnt have much past kd and kyrie and that celtics defense in the nd half of the season was one of the best ive ever seenkd is still not even great at attacking double teams his only weakness is his playmaking and how hes often a second late at finding the open man so you can double team him and not get punished for it like you will with bron harden or jokic guys like kd and kyrie are always score first and second so just being a tick slow allows defenses to recoverid argue that kd never really figured this out as well as he needed to in order to be the st option on a championship team gifted scorer but you cant put him in charge of organizing the offense like you can with tyrese steph nikola giannis and surprisingly sga sga passed well enough in the finals to keep double teams honest massive leap in his game recentlyi thought ant had an insanely great game facilitating against okc in that high scoring g if he made more of the s he took that wouldve been his best playoff game in my opinion he does need to get consistent with it though and play more into the middysame with pg during his pacers tenure there was a time where it felt like every time he tried to split a double team it was a turnovereven the lakers had ant flustered at times with soft doubles and hedges he would just dribble at the top of the arc and you could see him struggle to process what his next move should be but i think thats something he will improve on in coming seasonsexactly they double team greats to get the ball out of their hand or they double team you because you suck under pressurethe mavs tried doubling tatum in game of the finals last year at halftime he had assists and the celtics were up having a good team around you helps for sure but great playmakers cant be doubled too oftenyeah people are missing the point herei just assume that anyone who is missing the point must not have played basketball and probably doesnt actually watch it much its a pretty straightforward and simple concept teams double team ballhogs in high schoolcade was regularly seeing or defenders the year with monty coaching because monty decided isaiah stewart and killian hayes qualified as spacingi think its a bit more complicated than that players like luka jokic lebron embiid sga and trae young all see or have seen a lot of double teams even if they are great or high level passers sometimes its worth the risk of them getting a free basket off a pass if you can make them cough the ball up to a worse playmaking teammateits a big reason why jokic is always in mvp contention his combo of size scoring dribbling and passing make it to where any defensive adjustment like a double team is uselessthey do if the other teammates cant score on their own trae is always one of the most doubled players for instance luka is double a ton in dallas they would rather the ball be out of their hands and make the other teammates scorei can only go to top on statmuse but haliburton isnt even in the top thats a death sentence to play them with doubling hali bc they have other people that can scorethats not true the best playmakers are the ones that can draw defenders and attack different looks in the pnr including blitzes and traps we dont have ricky rubio or kendall marshall players anymore that cant shoot or drive but can passluka is doubleteamed all the timedraymond said of lebron youre afraid to not double team him but youre also afraid to double team him cause hed punish you for itluka and jokic get double teamed like crazy and they are like two of the top passers in the leaguea funny exception is luka because even though he makes the right play its statistically still worth it just to take the ball out of his handswere nets fans even watching nets games last season its hard as hell to be super invested when you know the team is tankingi like in bk and went a couple gameszach and rob are spot on here hes a fun player when hes on but he has to dominate the ball and if hes not cooking then it kills the offensein a slightly different way giddy the other top rfa also has a similar problem though hes seen as a passer hes really only effective with the ball in his hands but hes just not that good to have him holding onto the ball for the entire time over an game season plus his defensive effort is simply not consistent enough despite his size and athleticismthats why teams arent warring amongst themselves for these guys theyre good enough to put up decent volume stats but they wont get you over the hump to consistently get ws real contenders have no need for them tanking teams dont want them and they cant elevate midtier rostersi think i only watched the nets against the magichell a lot of nets fans didnt watch nets games last season loli definitely tuned in a bit less im ashamed to admitevery time i caught one of your games it seemed like you had a completely different lineup of guys id never heard ofi do agree with others that he would be a fantastic bench scorer on a team that needs a second burst but hes not a starter at his current skill set but its lots of pounding the rock and chuckingsounds like a pretty good reason to double teamhis final game of the season before sitting out the rest of the year was a assist game and it looked easy for him he absolutely improved as the season went on and definitely has the tools to be a good playmaker at least occasionallystill more assists than his new teammate mpjthey cant and its a tiring thing that sticks on cam cam isnt the best passer but for the games he was playing he was passing and doing the right reads still needs work but isnt the ball hog were everyone on the media or anyone online make it seem to bethis exactly the nets arent trying to win shit rn so who cares if the guy receiving the pass is good at shootingi know right cam thomas should be looking to pass to check notes tosan evbuomwan he can balllowe talked about that the question is if cam has it in him to change his approach from seeing himself as the guy and general feedback is that teams are concerned he canthim and schroeder were the best backcourt in the league for like a week i remember they beat phx and gs at their placeid be for a ct jk swap loli want claxton freeded man hes such an underrated player he needs to be on a team with playoff aspirationsand dfsremoveddifference are that they are simply much better players giannis is not that great of a passer better than thomas but giannis has so much gravity that it creates looksi think spinning being double team as a bad thing is stupid but context is importantwell the supporting cast of luka and giannis versus thomaschampionship level nba team lmao thats a funny way of saying giannis has a ring n luka doesnt as far as im concerned cam n luka in the same boatits a response to what cam thomas himself saidat the time they had kyrie kd and james harden of the most prolific scorers of all time it was a head scratcher to draft a score first guard when their priority at the time was win in the next few years and he was the furthest thing from what they needed of course hindsight is but its only because kyrie and kd blew that team up thats youre looking at it like this i didnt use the word mistake i did say it was a head scratcher because of the direction they clearly had chosen to go in which spoke to the larger point i was making of the nets being a terrible organization and we wont know the caliber of player he truly is capable of being therefor fun i agree it wasnt a bad or disrespectful take i just found him defending himself for nothing pretty funnylook at his team man to simply chalk up the rate that hes double teamed to its only becuase he doesnt pass is bullshit im not even a cam thomas fanthey sold half of those players at the deadline or earlier lmaohomie check what the rest of the team shot check what the averages of players shooting that volume check dbooks recent s then factor in its his first year as the main scorer in the worst situation in the leaguethats not bad for a guard check what donovan mitchell and anthony edwards shotfuck you toohe had to solve that problem because terry stotts sure as hell wasnt doing anything totbh the nets offence in that series was really good kd moved the ball fine the issue was defensively they couldnt stop shiti also remember being super impressed by the coaching in that series like you said the celtics were throwing really weird double teams at him that i dont think ive ever seen before even with the birdseye view of watching as a viewer i had no idea where the doubles were coming fromnd half of celtics was amazingi still cant believe people rate warriors chip at the bottom of the s that celtics team was nastyhe struggled with it until he joined the warriors and defenses werent able to double the same way because they were more scared of stephhe does that same shit in phoenix too but no one wants to acknowledge it because wow ppg shoots over people with easepart of those guys seeing double teams is their surrounding cast part of it is putting physical and mental wear on them part of it is mixing up looksnone of that negates the fact that being a bad passer and ballhog is an extremely appealing combo to send aggressive double teams its not the only reason to do so but its a very good onelebron never sees double teams its historically one of the biggest things teams dont dolol he would love more double teams makes the passing easier its a big reason why jokic is always in mvp contentionit is a big reason why every great big is in contention giannis gets so many guys easy threes embiid and giannis were always in the running for the mvps for the same seasons for the same reasons they consistently drew doubles and made playsi can only go to top on statmuse but haliburton isnt even in the top bc his teammates can score if hes doubledits not only because his teammates can score thats ridiculous to ignore the fact hes one of the best pure passers in the nba right nowluka is the only exception of an elite passer that gets constantly double team like that and its just cause he is the best player to lead an offense in the nba letting luka get into a pnr is just never worth it even if you have to play vi feel like the double teams in question here in regards to thomas are more so traditional double teams not pnr blitzes i could be wrong and yeah in that case its different thomas isnt running a ton of pnr either since his passing isnt greathe gets blitzed on pnr a lot but hes not getting traditional double teams that muchhe did get doubled more after being traded because of the new team fit lakers had to learn how to position themselves use the numbers advantage the team wasnt used to such high double teamstbh i think a lot of the stats of luka double teams were when he was like the entire offense with kyrie in and out and the mavs roster being mid i suspect that the threat of reaves and lbj over time will lower the double team numbers since luka is solid at making the right play out of those traps and has even said he likes it because he can conserve energy or smth iircand the ppp out of that situation is an alltime offensejokic feasts on double teams what data say he sees them at a high rate pnr blitzes are not the same as the double teams they are talking about here with cam thomasyou have issues understanding basketballyes we were to cheer for the other teami can be into our tanking team but i admit i watched less last season than i have in years we are gonna tank again next season but im more interestedinvested because we have all these rookies to develop and or more of them may be a piece of our futurelast season we were bad and i had no clue if anyone on the roster would still be around in a year so it was hard to care beyond the draft position you knownot at all and i used to watch all no interest in a tank job esp if ct is outsame but for heat and lakers not much interest in watching a tanker unless my favorite teams play them or are themhis peak is being a new lou williams which is a very good nba career but yeah not the kinda guy who you win with as a first optionwe needed a guy like him on the warriors last year just someone to take a fucking shot and not pass the ball times till the shot clock runs outbut not for mil fantastic bench scorer he would be great a sixth man heat check guy for a contender he can get his shot off by himself almost all the time i just cant imagine him closing later round playoff gameshe also chose not to pass to checks my notes which are the actual game logs of when he played cam johnson dennis schroder and dorian finneysmithtosan can ball i think thats the guys pointits not that deep he made a comment that shouldnt have a been a big deal cam lost his mind over it and hes getting responses back for it no one is treating him like a villain its not a conspiracy nobody is immune to criticisms you need to get help your comment is more unhinged than cams it wasnt a personal attack but you lost your mind i cant imagine having to deal with someone like you in life someone that could go off at any moment over something that really doesnt matter at the end of the day difference are that they are simply much better playerswell thats kinda the point those players get doubled due to being a massive threat cam gets doubled because hes only a threat to shootdoubling players like giannis is a need players like cam are just a basic defensive schemethe bucks dont have shit outside of giannisits also their playmaking ability vs thomass lack of playmaking for othersthis might actually be the single dumbest take ive seen on rnba and im far lower on luka than most people thanks for the laughi never said such a thing and neither did they they said part of the equation for teams to choose to double him is that he doesnt effectively get the ball out of the double team and then you said thats the dumbest basketball take youve heard in a while even though there is truth to italso why use quotes when you arent quoting anything anybody said or even a sentiment they expressedin that clip he literally said that part of the reason why hes double teamed is that nets dont have a lot of good scorers maybe try watching it againcam thomas stopped playing in novembercan thomas played all of his games with at least two of those guysyou mean anthony edwards who shot on pa per game last yearall you mothafuckastheir offense was great mostly do to role players shooting out of their minds kd def did not have a good seriesthat was such a funny series because every statistical indicator said the celtics should crush the nets but a bunch of talking heads still picked the nets and didnt trust the celtics and then the series ended up exactly like youd predict if you just looked at the numbers going in i know games were reasonably close but i didnt think for a single second the nets had a shot to win the series after they lost that game ime is an elite coach and honestly people clown on him for not blitzing steph more but i think that was the best strategy we saw in game when you do and face guard him at half court the rest of the team just gets super easy buckets i think if they stuck to that gameplan they mightve won because everyone else was playing bad as hell until they changed their strategy to shut down steph at all costsmake steph beat you averaging instead of giving role players wide open shots and layupsime was working for the nets beforehand so i dont think there was a team better equipped both personnel and knowledge wisethe celtics played their worst series in the finals and they were running on fumes after brk mke and mia which was a gauntlet so most people remember that image of the team not the one prior like tatum was having an alltime playoff run before that final series but after he played terribly people only remember the negativei dont know where id rank the warriors but with how wiggins was playing and steph having arguably his best series that team could compete with anybody i still wonder what a healthy rob williams would have done for that celtics team as he was the main reason there defense was so dominant but of course health has always been williams biggest problem and the playoffs are brutal for those type of playersyeah out of those i think the only one who gets constantly double teammate even though he is an elite passer is luka jokic and lebron dont get double teamed as much its just not worth it the others are not as elite in play making luka is such a menace with the ball in his hands that you just have to get it away from him no matter whatexactly the only adjustment ive seen is covering all the passing lanes and forcing jokic to be a ball dominant scorer hes very good at that but its not the way he wants to playaccurate going back to george mikan people realized that being large and athletic kind of breaks the game of basketball its also part of why portland took oden over durant both were seen as great prospects but the blueprint of oden being the next dominant big was already set durant was obviously talented as a prospect but people werent sure he was strong enough to be a game breaker like odendid i say that tf is he one of the best passers thats why i included him he doesnt see the same doubles as trae luka or harden tho not even closehe does get double teamed a lot since its better to not let him even start the pnr but he is an exception not the rulehe was getting double teamed way more then nd place in dallas aswell nothing to do with the tradeyeah its kind of fun watching the initial stages of a rebuild when you have prospects to be excited about but youre still cool with the team losing watching the tear down is a lot harder lolclax doingwhatever he was doing last year didnt help either some nights were straight up embarrassingi can very much relate to thisi felt the exact samemuch more excited about this season thanks to the rookieswe needed a guy like him on the warriors last yearcam thomas for kuminga who stops kerr from saying yes firstare you acting this obtuse on purposebased off of what exactlyyou wrote all that just to show you dont understand hyperbole saying treated like a villain was clearly exaggeration for effect you took a figure of speech and built a personality analysis off it like youre auditioning for csi reddit edition maybe try understanding tone before diagnosing strangers over imaginary offenses the irony of calling someone else unhinged while ranting like this is incredibleand its not like lukas mavs teams started out amazing eitheralso its ridiculous to even mention thomas with of the top players in the league and future hall of famersnot great players but they do have shooters around him at all times with green trent turner and princethis is some revisionism bucks literally had a game where a role player hit a bunch of s and forced ot in the playoffs he also has brooks one of the best shooting big men giannis team is better than a team that is tanking at the bottom of the east luka just went to the finals the year prior and had kyriewashingtongrimessideshow bob thomas def doesnt have better people to pass to compared to those two its also not like thomas is a top playerwell u said nothing basketball related in your response instead u responded like a celtics fan would so believe it or not i dont know u but i do the convo was about players who command double teams n said players knowing when to pass outta those double teams u inserted luka in the convo yet called him a championship level player which he aint we dont call vince carter tmac barkley embiid karl malone dbook harden westbrook etc championship level players bcuz they aint won a chip n they all commanded double teams u dont get to conveniently insert luka in that convo on a post thats practically dissing cam thomas yet they both aint won so i said what i said have a good wknd kid i dont care the overall message was cam thomas is a black hole nerds who cant hoop talking hoop will always bother mecharitably to the other guys point edwards first years of shooting is pretty close to thomasdoesnt rob mahoney have sickle cell or somethingmy makes suretake moneyhe had a poor series shooting the ball but he moved it out of double teams well baring in mind that kyrie also shot like shit his teammates hit their open shots like they were supposed tothat postcovid season really tricked a lot of people into thinking that the covid teams were a flash in the pan lakers heat and celtics all got bounced round and the nuggets round kd is the most unguardable player ever deepest bag he just shoots over you gets clamped and sweptsome shot in game steph was just flat out missing thoiirc warriors had a top ranked defense so it makes sense the celtics would struggle offensively not sure why people just think they had a bad series instead of giving the warriors defense credit they also forced luka into a very mediocre seriesthey also smacked the nuggets and mavsits also how the nuggets lose the mostjokic at his best is a point triple double his worse is a point rebound assist game still obviously very elite but if jokic is scoring but everyone else cant hit the side of the rim to save their life you pretty much winyeah in the case of jokic its just better for you if he leads the offense with the ball in his hands its not that he is bad at it its just the worst part of his offense which just says how good he is at everything elseok so why would you only include the part that bc his teammates can score you already edited the comment lmaoyou have zero basketball knowledge based on your comment be quieti honestly dont mind thiswhich part is obtuse the part where i said cam thomas doesnt pass or the part where i listed out the people he played withhes in the nbagary trent jr hitting a bunch of threes in a game does not mean he doesnt have a bottom tier supporting castall yo kids dont growi think youre remembering that series wrong kd had turnovers in games most of them him being stripped in double teams he was also net rating which is pretty bad in such a close series was a turnover machine that series the series after that in phoenix against denver and the series after that against wolves bruce brown probably stripped him times in game one alone but he moved it out of double teams wellno he didnt half the game threads were people asking if he was washed because he was being neutralised so wellit can be both but also the warriors were and still are massively underrated for that year because it was years since their last ring they were considered old and theyd been an averagely seeded teami did edit my comment but i never was saying hali isnt a good passer that wasnt my intent you read it wrong the person i commented on was saying good passers arent doubled and its not that simple it depends on the other players on the team as well they are deciding is it better to double and make him pass and make the other players win the game or play straight up the pacers are blessed with a bunch of players being able to score so they dont just flat out double hali i wasnt rating anyones passing abilityoh wow never knew thanks for clarifying someone should let the netss front office know so he can get minutes a night and not be back forth in the gleague during the seasoni never was saying hali isnt a good passeri never said you did my point was the hali example is not as simple as him having good teammates even if his teammates were not as good he is still not someone to double due to his vision and passing ability yes some good passers get stuck with bad supporting casts and in turn the double teams increase but the better the player is at passing the harder it is to double team themhey theres at least one guy that agrees with your take cam thomas which is exactly why hell never develop past being a scorefirst ball hogi agree i wasnt saying that was the only reason just adding context to why he may see less doubles i dont think hes that much of a better passer than trae or luka to see half the double teams tho although he is less of a scoring threat so that might add more context as well i was just saying it isnt as simple as good passers dont get doubled bc thats not the case harden luka trae jokic are all in the top of most doubled it actually appears that its the opposite and the best passers besides hali are all doubled the mostboth of those things work against each other if tyrese had way worse teammates ge would get doubled more if he was a better scorer in comparison to his teammates he would get doubled more too these things arent mutually exclusivethe other guy was comparing tyrese to other playmakers who are just as good if not better some days at playmaking so the isolated factor is the teammates its also the scoring ability but he didnt mention thatya know both things can be true right lol',\n",

there and i dont see any team being positioned to do a st that makes sense he either has to take a short deal and go to ufa as a secondary piece or take a longer deal and accept his role on the temasteph and butler are old theyll get rest andor hurt hell have games during the season to get his fill on shots and love from the fans those chances will only grow as he gets deeper into that contract given the guys block him from his desired opportunities are and years oldhe could get his money from gs play out the stephbutler years as the th manrd offensive option then end his contract in the chucker on a bad team role he seems to prefer to stat pad for a big contract into his lateskuminga really fumbled a bagteams that should call with an offer thatd be helpful to the warriors us probablythink jerami grant would be good for gsw and then they can probably force out a first for taking on the contract also think its easier for a team to swallow giving a first round pick for the one you dont want if youre taking back a contract clippers some combination of bogdonovic with either derick jones jr or kris dunn and a protected first i think the warriors would love kris dunnthe chicago bulls vucevic or some combination of expirings this one i see on those fake news sources they show you on your ig feed phoenix suns i mean grayson allen and royce probably idkhe should force a trade to minny tim connelly will give him boatloads of money just like mpjthis guy gonna fuck up generational wealthapologies but can someone inform me im a rockets fan who only watches warriors games when theyre playing us which is a lot evidently but what is the deal with kuminga they were obviously trying to beat us every game and i dont remember seeing him much when he did play he wasnt very impactful why is he trying to command m a year is he sneaky good whats going onhe will be lucky to get mill a yearthis is clickbait nonsense no one ever would offer him that windhorst and everything he touches is nothing but hot airunpopular opinion id take it tooits been repeated multiple times that he rejected a last offseason and wants one now which is why this is relevantslater who reported that in the first place is now saying it wasnt therewho tf is giving jonathan kuminga m dollarsi cant see him getting the money he wants at anything more than a yr dealno warrrior fans believe he turned it down thoughreplacing beal n kd for jg and jk is nasty workwe just want a team that plays hardg league ignite no feelteam with a great highlight reel that finishes nets is the answer trade for jalen green sign kuminga extend cam thomas having your starting core of greenthomasmpjkuminga with first round picks off the benches is peak entertainmentits gonna produce the grizz a top pickmost nba news is bullshit but men dont have soap operasslater is the reason that rumor exists btw unfortunately you left an opening for everyone to leave the same exact comment and thats kind of our favorite thing to doslater now the warriors never made a firm offer hes changed his tune quite a bit after being the one that started the smear campaign against kuminga last offseason lol has he even apologized for thatthis post you made days ago didnt clear that updennis schrder just woke up in a cold sweatlmao legit making it sound like hes making some big sacrificevalid if i was a young player id want to get as far away as possible from steve kerrbyah this was the craziest take i heard after listening to the pod with windy jalen johnson does way more at a higher skill level id be insulted if kuminga is a compnot with dray still on this teamtheyve tried offering him i believethats the holdup he wants more lolhow do you fumble a bag that you never got in the first placehed have developed way better if he pickedhis draft teamcrazy nd rounders get to pick their teams and not lotto picksdepends on which ws fan you askkuminga either is not very good and doesnt deserve m per or he hasnt had an opportunity to prove his worthimo when he plays hes damn frustrating to watch too much ball watching shouldve taken him just a few games his rookie season to figure that out but here we arenot me i would take a paycut to stack my rosterjesus wheres your dignityso why should anyone believe this dude nowyeah it seemed like that reporting was to put it bluntly a lie by the warriors org to depress kumingas resign valuedeletedhe not getting myr contract he would be lucky to get m a yearsometimes not all the time but sometimes spending m is better than spending m another m x in additional luxury tax when its basically a puntsearching for upside seasonold boring descending players versus two athletic yr old ascending playersthese are not initial dudes kd turned down a great nickname slim reaper to be kd we wont acknowledge his tbone nickname suggestion servantgreen and kuminga if beal never became or deserved an acronym with bb those dudes arent getting that treatmentright year olds with potential such a poverty franchise why dont they just sell booker n tank without their picks alreadythat is extremely optimistic in this years westthats a win team if i ever saw one theyd be like why play d we have the bag and are trash lets just stat pad and party league is getting smarter about overpaying guys that dont actually add wsholy inefficiency that core would not work togetherwweliterally the exact same playbook they used onwith klay thompson during his last season fake declined contract offer report to open up the season fanbase bashes him all season calls him selfish with a massive ego washed etc as a result later comes out that warriors never made a firm offer literally the exact same phrase was used lol shit you not after klay ultimately left in the offseason and that had there been one he would have likely accepted it so with that said lol no slater has not and will not apologize for the false report because it was purposefully donesome of these young nba players need someone to smack some sense into themis there a report they offered that fumble the could have been bag by rejecting the offerby publicaly demanding an unreasonable contract and playing completely selfish so other teams see that you are not playing winning basketballthats helpful thanksfuck the roster im getting me and my grandchildren generational wealthwith vet minimumsbecause hes the main beat writer all of these guys make mistakes other than like shamsthis is my least favorite part of free agency where teams put out hit pieces to hurt the value of their rfas kuminga and cam thomas have been hit hard this weekin the end these are all young men trying to maximize their careers these sagas bring me absolutely no joyhes saying the reports of him rejecting were incorrectright now yeahbut i wouldnt be surprised if the warriors had offered before the season and he declined because he wanted facts the suns did a magnificent job getting under the nd apron this offseasongreen and jk will nvr be as good as a yr old kd or a year old beal and what makes u say their ascending theres a reason why no one wanted green phx themselves said they didnt and only the kings and suns want jk sorry franchises in years green has shown little improvement and jk thinks hes better than wht he isneither of these players are ascending real life is not k it does not matter that they are what you see now is the best you are ever getting guys do not magically become better one year youd see the development if it was happening green and kuminga have been the same players for years they have peaked their developmentcan you point out what makes jalen green an ascending player his stats and his game as been the exact same since hes been in the league just because a player is young doesnt mean hes ascending lollol not that deeptheyve showed minimal improvement in the areas they need improvement inthe difference is that soap operas are faketheyre still under that old cba mindsetwhich i dont blame them for but their agents should have known betteror maybe he just doesnt want to play for the warriors anymore kerr clearly does not like him as a player i wouldnt want to be there if i were himsaw on here he was looking for but warriors didnt want to do more than its reddit sowho knows im too lazy to try and find it again tbhi meant to say in that comment that there were reports by slater who he himself is now saying its not true anymore he backtracked on them a while backhedidnt get any serious offers the unreasonable contract he turned down wasnt therei think mil could still be generational wealth but also help out the teamthey did offer and he declined it lmaohe doesnt want to be a warrior another year let alone anything is better than the oldwashed roster the suns ran out there last season green and kuminga have some upside at least if you squint hard enough theres a seed possibility if everything goes perfectlykd for sure but jg and kuminga combined are better than a year old beal making more than million with a ntckd and beal are washed green and kuminga will continue to get better and have a long run way and suns have th most wins since and th most playoff wins if thats a sorry franchise than give me more of that pleasei am not a huge fan of judging players when they are in an environment like what these guys were in however if they dont improve in this new environment then ill lower my expectationssometimes your situation can stagnant your development n potential isnt linear u never know who might pop offyeah thats a good point dude saw guys like quickley collins and rozier get ish and figures they aint better than me but teams arent gonna pay th option roleplayers like that anymorehis agent posted in the middle of the season they expext zhe maxmaybe for your kids my kids need that extra m of insurance because theyre dumb as shitthis is a liea lot of that stuff came out this past season thoughi think heading into the season he was more optimistic about his role on the team maybe he thought hed be starting more often or at least play his way into starter minutes but instead he did the oppositeexactly the suns went from a top oldest roster in the nba last year to the seventh youngest roster give me that over the old diva driven team than quit on their coach by december last yearmaybe in the east theyd be lucky to sniff the playins in the west even with everything going perfectlywho tf are they replacing to get to those seedsbeals looked bad bc his contract but he still avg a ultra efficient ppg as a third option at mil ppg isnt good bit if he was on jgs contract that is great value jg offensively is not better than brad beal todaywe will create kd in the aggregatekd in will be a better player than either of those two will ever be in their careerof course my problem is how everyone says their shit with such confidencemaybe but green was given the keys to do as he pleased for multiple seasons its not like he was forced into a limited role hes a microwave but those arent as hard to come by as many thinktheyll put up s but they wont be efficientim sorry brother but thats a huge cope right there kuminga and green are the prototype of empty stats chasing losing playersagents ask for the max to get their client as much money as possiblealso i am not seeing thati meant last season before the start they did offer him i like how it was reported he was offered as well as that the offer was never on the table and were all just going with whatever fits our narrative classicthe team that quit in their coach includes booker i dont see a world where this team stays bad and booker still elects to stay especially with him securing his supermaxgreen also played more games than beal did last seasonyes but he wasnt on jgs contract which was like the main issue lol also he only plays in like games a year and it wasnt like he missed a month with an injury but played the rest it was like he played games missed then played another games then missed just really hard to build any sort of rhythm and continuity with thatfans are so weird trying to act like they have won every trade we lost a top player of all time lol we got cooked its fine happens to every team eventually saying those dudes will somehow be better than kd is crazy workyes n most of those years were tanking situations n all those years with very little spacing sometimes starting a guy out in a limited role is a good thing allows u to build up gradually something he wasnt allowed to dohonestly high volume sgs who arent efficient are a dying breed in the nbakuminga true shooting was a consistent his first years so thats bold of you to say with such confidence green yeah definitely might happen stillnever have been able to see him play off a true star who spaces the floor alongside him or good spacing in general would not be suprised his volume stays the same n the splits jump yes its coping to think year olds with potential can improveyeah i just believe nothing at this point same for me as the what did jordan say to draymondand what about the other seasons where he didnt quit lolbeal has always been efficient green if im not mistaken hes nvr shot over in his careerkuminga has nvr had a fg and in yrs your talking ab he was getting minimal shot att he shot this szn not too bad but he is a poor pt and ft shooter greens problem is his shot iq hes supposed to be a slasher but cant get to the rim consistently bc he refuses to get stronger hes supposed to be a knockdown shooter but cant shoot either once they blitz him he has no clue what to do w the ball hes getting to that stage of his career where he is what hes shown us to beim sorry your team sucks man but dont pretend that kuminga is gonna solve any of your problemshe quit on vogel tooyoure not mistaken but it doesnt change the fact that in the last four seasons beal has played games to greens efficiency only goes so far when you dont playtrue shooting stupid learn to read huh i didnt realize was the end of your development cycle someone call steve nash tell him the mvps never happenedhe didnt say fgsolves problems for the suns they need playmaking and perimeter defense more than anything jk and green provides i havent seen this team play yethave youbooker under vogel literally changed his position for the team and had the best season of his career both efficiency wise and passing wise wat r u talking aboutfacts but green is a downgrade from bealyou didnt put true shooting you definitely js edited your comment steve nash was always a good player phx js gave him opportunity if jalen was a good player houston wouldve just kept him theres a reason why phx themselves said they didnt want green until they had no choice but to take himhe edited his commentbrooksdunn some of the better poa defense in the league booker top assiststhe team actually needs rim pressure youth and potential more than anything u can really tell the ppl who watch espn takes on the suns n ppl who actually watch the sunsamazing argument buddy i havent watched the wizards play yet this year but i can guarantee you they wont make the playoffsthey quit on him after going down to the clippers from tht point on they were a disastersure if you ignore cost availability and locker room impact its a massive downgradeno i didnt u just cant read everybody goes off true shooting i would never be dumb enough to go off field goal percentage tf would anyone think a wing has a fg anyways fucking dumb bro please sit down steve nash was not always a good player plenty of guys have improved even into their late s maybe houston was wrong phx never said that maybe a reporter didahh i seebrooks defense fell off this seasondo the wizards have a guy that lead their team within games of a title wizards dont even have capable starters suns have good comphow was beal a negative in the locker room did any of his teammates speak against himgambo did and every suns fan ive encountered takes his word for goldi didnt he lyingit wasnt anything he actively did it was more so his presence as an aging oft injured player on a massive contract with a ntcfind me that exact quote highly doubt a suns mouthpiece gunna frame the trwde like that tf suns fans have to do with anything are these suns fan yknow in the front officehis teammates seemed to enjoy his presence thoughgambadoro explicitly stated that the suns had no interest in acquiring jalen green as part of a possible kevin durant trade and that the team had no intention of including green in any dealhe does seem like a really good guy but the reality of his time with the suns was not positivelink that quotes redirects me to something completely differenti understand that but that doesnt mean he was a negative in the locker roomi just think that being a negative in the locker room isnt always the fault of the players actions but the impact of their presence similarly a player could be a positive impact despite being a massive douchebag because of the way they impact winningedit phrasingif youre teammates dont like you youre a negative in the locker room no matter how good you are on the court',\n",
       " 'weirdest hostage situation since the deandre jordan sweepstakeswe dont want this dude but ill be god damned if someone else is getting this dudewarriors are lucky that horford and melton are being patient throughout all thissame thing happening with grimes pretty shitty that the mle is able to affect rfa like thisutah dont want this guy lolso why wouldnt a team just offer him a contract and force the warriors to make a move you either get kuminga or al horfordwhy does gs want kuminga though purely for st it doesnt seem like they value him as a player all that highlykinda hope the warriors are forced to resign him just to see that drama unfold the front half of the seasonis this pacers max contract deandre ayton but worse every kuminga thread people say hes overvalued and disrespected by the warriors yet no one seems to want himwhether theyre right or wrong this is petty as hell lolhorford should sign somewhere else just to fuck with them loluhh were trying to develop like dudes right now is kuminga the vet thats gonna teach our rookies the ropes lmaokuminga doesnt work in our system but if we let him go he might be a star in another team we cant let that happensuns owner will easily give million per year we just have nothing gs wantsjust let him go already to the suns hahawarriors are so desperate to not let a guy that clearly wants to leave leave they had years to trade him and now being spiteful that they didnt do it in time and now he wants to leave hahathey will be lucky to get anything back and if he accepts the qo they get nothing he cruises a year then goes next offseasonwill never understand gsws loyalty to this guy ceiling is way too low to be this attachedthis is ridiculous the man obviously doesnt want to play there the warriors obviously dont want him to play there either theyre just holding him hostage at this point his value is only going to drop lower the longer they hold on to himif its between cam thomas and kuminga i wouldnt mind taking a gamble on kumingas physical giftsplus we drafted way too many guards to give that money to camtheyre fucked either way though either give up jk for some small trade options or get qoed by someone that can afford jk and then be forced to have to eat that salary because of a qo when he resignsthe warriors fucked themselves they should have offloaded him ages agoi mean we all know al horford and melton are gonna sign so in essence the moves are made in spirit just nothing official because of the jk situationjust swap kuminga for cam thomaswhy wouldnt the nets sign him to an offer sheet with cap space make the warriors match or get an upside talent that can either be traded for assets later breaks out into a good player or is off the books by the time you are actually good againthis stuff going over my head thanks a lot kuminga for making this so complicatedyeah except we wanted djhas anyone driven around the bay area asking via texts for an address yetthat one ex be likestephchan is a tsunderewarriors are really going to waste what is probably the last or one of the last good years steph will have trying to get a second round pick out of kumingai mentioned this in the warriors subreddit and boy let me tell you they mad mad he wont play ball with the warriors foits not that we dont want him he has value he just doesnt fit with what we have going on that is not to say a change in scenario doesnt help him so instead of bidding against ourselves or trading him for scrap we want to maximize whatever we can of him as an asset its not that hard to understand teams have done this for yearsexcept the warriors have said multiple times that they do want kuminga back they just arent willing to meet the insane price his reps are setting in order to do sothe warriors are just being shitty to kuminga at this point and people need to start calling it out for what it is you dont want the guy theres clearly no serious trade market for him just go about your business already and let the guy go elsewhere theyre holding him ransom for peanuts the point of rfas was never to hold a guy hostage like this it was to stop better orgs from stealing guys from less desirable teams for cheaper moneykerr doesnt even want to play kuminga half the time whats their leverage give us what we want or else well pay kuminga million a year so kerr can sit him on the benchhes their asset why would they allow him to walk for nothingits weird energymeanwhile cam thomas is begging for someone to offer anythingjust dont want them getting him for free if you want him give us something we can usei see youve also met that one chick that loves to flirt with you in front of everyone but keeps you at arms length when you try to take things further then when you move on she gets jealous and possessive of you in front of othersthey dont want to lose an asset with some decent value for nothing something is better than nothing even a few nd rounders sam presti always got something in return and look how okc turned outwarriors such gate keepers damni mean horford sure but melton cant have that great of a marketif the deal is already done it doesnt require patience at allthey will get signed either way its just the mechanics of how it happens could changelol whats shitty is the whole idea of a rfa let guys get paid and go where they wantcant think of a worse way to fuck up ace baileyi get that logic given what weve seen from him on the court at times and how he has butted heads with kerr but if they can offer more to get what others in the league might view as an asset thats not a terrible use of cap space imowho wants to play there like black people in that whole city you can have podziemskinets have the most space with m and the warriors would match thatnobody has cap space so it would have to be a sign and tradeno one has cap space this article is suggesting if warriors enter apron teams can clear cap space and make an offer warriors cant match but you dont want to clear cap space only to end up warriors matching and youve just cleared cap space for no reasoni think if a team really wants jk they can keep waiting otherwise youd need kuminga or his agent to basically call in a favor from another team and have this other team give jk an offer sheet to force the warriorss hand but apparently his agent does not have enough connectionskuminga isnt so good that people arent sweating the idea of paying him any more than the absolute minimum itll take to get him away from the warriorsand as long as the warriors have the ability to match the theoretical number thats too rich for their blood is also too high for jonathan kuminga if on the other hand the warriors are locked into a manageable number then you can say okay we can do thattheres just no reason to clear huge space make some loony offer right now and screw yourself just to deprive golden state of a trade chip or clear reasonable space and have it be for nothing because oops matchedbecause you can always just wait until the end force the warriors to not make moves then put in the offer sheet at the last possible timedidnt that already happen wasnt the report that the kings and suns offeredat this point somebody couldshould just to call their bluff but the point is that once gs ties up their cap teams with less money can get involvedyes or for mid season tradewe dont value him lowly either we just value him realistically as a scorer off the bench while he values himself as a starter and primary option the two sides are never gonna see eye to eye on that so yes we want him mainly for st at this pointhelpful in the regular season and you can use his salary for another deal at the deadlinebecause they think that they can use him as a trade chip which is better than losing him outrighti think theyre fooling themselves hell get so little playing time that his trade value will further dropsign him for a reasonable price aka in the mil range so we can have basically a hefty contract to trade for the next disgruntled star or be part of a major trade that lands us some pieces it gives us leverage and maneuverability with the capkumingas not important enough to cause real drama if he throws a temper tantrum no one will care locker room vibes will be unaffected by himsame well get at least months of drama out of this this is the mostly likely outcome lolthats not what this is about kumingas salary is a trade asset but if they give another team the ability to make him an offer they cant match then they lose that asset without getting anything in returngot nothing to do with his actual playing ability just his value in a tradeits the salary restrictionshe represents an ability to go above the salary capif he leaves you dont just get his cap hold as space since their team is built on exceptions like every team except the nets right nowits not loyalty hes an asset theyre trying to get value for theyre just holding him hostage at this point so they should just let him go for nothingi think the warriors are angling to have kuminga back on an extremely teamfriendly deal thats far more tradeable he could take the qo just to say fuck you but thats an enormous risk for a guy that depends so heavily on his athleticism he may never get a contract ever again i predict they split the difference and he signs something like my that gives him m what hed be getting from the qo for the first year plus what he thinks hes worth for a second year m but guaranteed the warriors get a verytradeable m contract and the incoming team gets a guy very probably worth more than m on a teamfriendly deal even if hes parked on the bench in street clothes the warriors are going to get a lot more back for years of kuminga at myear than years of myear or whatever hes asking for on a sign and tradewhy should the nets take a metaphorical bullet for some other teameveryone is protecting their own interests its not golden state versus the world right now if they offer the warriors match they get nothing and the only beneficiary is whoever ends up signing the warriors other playersthe nets would presumably prefer to come out of this with something other than nothingbecause kuminga is not a good player and they would rather use the cap space to get paid to take on a bad contract than give out one themselvesits thru texts you philistineoof that one hit meits been a constant theme since the two timelines approach just a waste of his late primewhere are they wasting whatthey basically have secured horford and melton do you think they should just let kuminga walkthey need a dominating big center badly draymond doesnt count as one post is not ityou guys making things up just to hate theyre not wasting it because their realistic targets are willing to wait for the dust to settle they want the salary to maintain some trade flexibility whether its on the qo or whatever contract kuminga can secure for himself people want to hate because its the warriors but this is literally how rfa works and both sides are playing chickenhe shouldnt play ball with them too warriors have shown him respecti mean anyone could have called out that kerr burned that bridge and quadrupled down on it how they mad that no team is throwing him the bag and he is taking his time i dont blame himits a cesspool over there i unsubscribedseriously just trade him for either monk or derozan and get it over withit not just the price kuminga wants a stable role not kerrs bullshit rotationslet the guy go elsewherehes free to sign an offer anywhere he likes the warriors dont owe him or some prospective new team a sign and tradeyeah they should give up one of their only half decent assets just because are the nets being shitty to cam thomas for taking advantage of no one having cap space for him are the bulls being shitty to giddey its a business and each side uses whatever leverage they have to get the best outcome possible kuminga had already been offered m a year and turned it down because he wanted now no one will offer him that and hes stuck playing tug of war with the warriors its on him to either accept a lower offer or find someone willing to pay him more he could even sign a qualifying offer and leave after seasonhold a guy hostage its not a franchise tag he is free to receive contract offers from any other team warriors just have the ability to match the only way they can stop him from leaving is to pay him literally just as much as anyone else is willing to payso if i dont want my guitar anymore instead of selling it i should put it out on the streetwe arent holding him hostage he wants mil a year are we supposed to give him mil a yearyou have to give up something to get somethingif the warriors prefer to retain him and trade him at the deadline for his full salary instead of half why should they not do it are the obligated to give him away whats their leveragethat other teams want him am i taking crazy pillsbecause sam presti knows how to manage his asset values sell when you think value is at its peak and hold on when its undervalued and value can be increasedthe warriors arnt doing thatpresti didnt wait til augustseptember to sign his rfasthey dont want a few second rounders they want a first round pick and young prospectthe clippers were roundly mocked for letting paul george walk for nothing last offseason and they won games sometimes it is addition by subtractionlmao presti absolutely never did something like this evera verbal agreement yeah but if im a player or agent in this situation im getting a little antsywithout rfa then wemby would be able to leave as soon as his rookie contract is upits supposed to be designed in a way that a team that drafts a player can retain that player longer while also giving the player the ability to leverage a better contract from another teamits not a bad idea but it needs to be retooled with the new cba rules but outright getting rid of restricted free agency would make it so that small market teams have an uphill battle to retain any stars they draftyes let young players leave their team as soon as possible fuck all the small market teams ability to even attempt retaining their young playersexcept durant who is hated for doing thisnah its probably the biggest lever in the league for keeping competitive balance between the haves and have nots the warriors are just abusing it here this was not the point of itthey can just need to play more year on a rookie scale deal for the flexibility to go wherever you want after that most rookies just want to get paid earlierhell yeah lets bad teams develop players for years and other teams with cap space just come poach them scompetition is good if ace cant outplay him then thats another issuebeing black and in sf is a very weird thing worked in tech and i was one of the only in rooms full of white b asian folks where did i see most of my people homeless or in sites living situations sf is a shitty place to be if youre affluent and black i hated being in the city because all i felt was survivors bias anyways podziemski got braids so he blackfishes enough anywaysthe warriors would be happy to match that youd be getting kuminga on a deal contract that would be a great trade asset before the deadlineonly the nets and jazz have cap space right now and neither have much it has to be a signandtrade if jk is to get close to the money he wantsand yes his agent sucks his only other notable players are kevin knox and terry rozier dude is probably trying to get a bag from jk because his future prospects dont look goodsounds like warriors have already made most of their deals with handshakes and verbal agreements they just can sign the contract until the situation is resolved they arent just sitting around with their thumb up their ass waiting for the phone to ringthose teams dont have actual cap space to sign him to an offer sheet so the offers being made now are all tradesi think both the suns and kings are working through trades whereas the nets and jazz would just be signing kuminga outright so theyre much more concerned about what price point would get the warriors to match or notbut will they actually play him it just seems weird they pulled him from the rotation knowing thered be a gap in negotiation talks but still want a high value for him in a tradei think the situation the warriors are angling for is to have kuminga back on an extremely teamfriendly deal thats far more tradeable he could take the qo just to say fuck you but thats an enormous risk for a guy that depends so heavily on his athleticism he may never get a contract ever again i predict they split the difference and he signs something like my that gives him m what hed be getting from the qo for the first year plus what he thinks hes worth for a second year m but guaranteed the warriors get a verytradeable m contract and the incoming team gets a guy very probably worth more than m on a teamfriendly dealexcept the ask for what they want in a trade does not equal a bench scorer lol thats my pointwe just value him realistically as a scorer off the benchthats really not true a scorer off the bench is getting more than myear thats like of your cap spaceyour second sentence is essentially my question i want a great prospect level return for a trade but we view him as a mpg type player going forwardi dont even think its that my understand is the way the cap etc works is that you can go over to sign your own players but cant to sign someone else so if they sign jk they create a salary slot that they can replace via a trade later if they dont sign him that slot is just gonefitting name for the postthe warriors kuminga drama is fascinating if hes not good enough that people wont pay attention to him babying in the locker room hes not enough to warrant the warriors asking price but if he really is good enough to warrant their asking price then it would definitely affect the locker room after an offseason clearly displaying they dont want himwarriors have another playin locked up with or without himthey had years to use that assetat this point they are really spiting a player that doesnt want to be there and that they dont want to keepthey are asking for a pick a young prospect and another decent player as salary filler they are not just trying to get a salary assetkumingas salary at myear is not a meaningful trade asset and in fact if the warriors end up retaining him and burying him deep into the bench like at the end of the seasonearly playoffs until steph got injured his trade value is further going to diminishi dont think theyd have trouble finding a trading partner their current reported asking price is just unrealisticis all this drama worth a second round pick or grayson alleni wasnt doing the meme im wondering if im missing a different new meme but okaygsw has literally won a championship since the raptors won theirs what a wasteimagine if they picked like halliburton instead of wiseman in meaning that they didnt have to play these timelines as bad and then in they make better choicesthen went from light years ahead to middle of the packthey did win ringsi dont understand why so many teams try to thread the needle with the two timelines approach pick one and use the other to supplement the one you choose if it fails so be it try again in a few years just a waste of his late primehow is trading kuminga wasting his primesame with thr lakers wasting lebron by refusing to give out longer contractslike you cant dnp and bench a guy and expect him to comply if im kuminga i got fucked so ima ruin your offseason toothe warriors dont owe him minutes and kuminga or any player dont owe their teams anything kuminga gets dnps because he refuses to adapt his game and has shown little improvement since getting drafted moody struggled getting minutes early on too and eventually earned a starter spot by improving his game and doing what his coaches ask him to if kuminga started using his physical tools to get some fucking rebounds or even just use his eyes to not lose his man on defense hed have problems getting minutesim not sure what you think respect is kuminga has had years to learn how to play with curry and has failed completely he has a very bad bbiqto be fair he has done absolutely nothing to justify respect he has completely refused to be a team playerhow are lakers fans the ones saying this wtf this is exactly how you signed reaves cheapget out of here with your knowledge we have some warriors to hate yeah they should give up one of their only half decent assets just becausetheyre basically holding him ransom over a second round pick at this point its just getting shitty hes not much of an asset are the nets being shitty to cam thomas for taking advantage of no one having cap space for him i dont think nets actually want cam thomas hes free to go elsewhere theres just no market for him hes a flawed player with some real injury concerngiddey and the bulls are merely disagreeing on his value right now but hell resign long term he wants a monster contract bulls want to give him more of a lets see you earn it first type dealwarriors are the only team with no interest and they basically wont let the guy go elsewhere because theyre threatening to match anythingthose teams also know that you dont want him and that kerr doesnt want to play himsince neither of those have been offered besides devin carter who doesnt help them right now of course the ask will remain high if a young players they are interested in or a st they value is offered the price probably comes down why start the negotiations asking for lessit wouldve cost the clippers over m in luxury tax to sign and trade paul george the warriors have no incentive to just let kuminga walk if he leaves for nothing then the warriors position doesnt change at all theres no norman powell or djj they would just lose kuminga for nothingwas thinking about exactly this yesterday literally every team thats ever moved off pg has been immensely better for it even when they got nothing directly in return but did sign djj dunn batum back and extend their guysim not that low on him but it is weird that its happened times now and obviously will be a th when philly gets off that contract and he retireshorford may just retire if things fall throughbut not being a player or agent you dont know what it means they probably dothe fuck you know about being eitheryou could still have something like bird rights so a max player is incentivized to resignthe problem is its at a huge expense to the player also this is controversial but i dont wanna have to wait for like yrs before i see a generational player like wemby fight for a chip the small teams must show more agency in building a championship team not just hold on to the star playerif wemby doesnt want to play for the spurs he should be able to leave the draft gives a team years if they cant convince a player to stay he shouldnt have tosmall markets arent inherently bad some players have enjoyed them and stayed loyalnot necessarily because theyre small markets but because the team works with their stars to keep them happy and in the right scenario that means being competitive rather than overpaying restricted free agency just gives them dibs it doesnt require them to build properlyi deleted about two paragraphs because i was starting to rant about money grabs and the inevitable impact of private equity in my opinionthey should at least make it easier to sign these players and trade them to their preferred destinationyes screw workers rights because my billionaire is cheaper than yoursah yes lets force a worker to work in a specific place and not give them agency to pick where they want to work this would never be acceptable in any other job why is it demanded in american sportsdurant didnt leave in rfa he left as an unrestricted free agentcouldve went to any single team in the nba besides the warriors and wouldnt have been hatedit still needs to be reformed make the matching period hours so other teams arent deterred from making offersmake the qualifying offer significantly higher kinda like the franchise or transition tags in the nfl the warriors are just abusing it here how are we abusing it were willing to match any other offeri dont think it helps build a young player to bring in someone at his same position who notoriously has interest in anyone but themselvesits not that simple in theory the two could co exist fine problem with kuminga is hes a powerful bull in a china shop that didnt work for golden state which is why he got jerked around so much the team he lands on has to be able to fit him properlyi dont think its a good deal at all naw signed for million a yearit wont be a signandtrade therell be a team that around the end of the summer offers jk m the warriors will match and everyone will be unhappy kerr still wont play jk and nobody will trade for a player with constant dnpcds that makes mhe was getting min before getting hurt and couldnt crack the rotation post jimmy hed probably get mpg minimum if he came back but maybe off the benchif they had him on a value contract they would play him so they can trade him at the deadlinewarriors play unique ball hes a tougher fit with them than he is with other teams hes very much a starter calibre player when you dont have a draymond or another non shooting forward on your roster and play simpler offensive schemestheyre asking for a promising young player plus a first round pick the joke being theyre asking for a kuminga frp for kuminga thats unsurprisingly posturing theyll take a lower offer as long as its not junk junk from the kingsit doesnt for a sign and trade but the warriors can essentially force him into signing a new teamfriendly deal and then trade him later in the yearhes averaged mpg the past seasons with the warriors only time he averaged less than was his rookie season theres no reason to believe he would get less playing time next season especially with how old the team is the dnps came because he couldnt mesh with the veterans after coming back from injury during the playoffs hes wasnt getting dnped during the regular seasonthis is the wrong framing they are fine with him on a cheap deal or for good trade value the market will just decide which one and the warriors are good with eitheryea thats exactly what the warriors stance is and mpg is being generous judging by what happened in the playoffs end of season there could be plenty of dnpcd toothey create a salary slot that they can replace via a trade laterby that reasoning wouldnt it benefit the warriors to offer him more money so that the salary slot is biggerthe answer is simple hes not that good the warriors are overvaluing him in trades which is hopefully a negotiating tactic and not their actual asking pricetheyre not spiting him theyll move him as soon as they can get something back for him that helps them win nowcause they dont actually want to do a st they prefer he take whatever theyre actually offering him so that they can trade him by the deadline that way they can use his full salary and not just half or whatever if he does a st theyll agree to a st if they can get an amazing offer thoughhow does this benefit the warriorsthe qo is not tradeable anyway the actual salary he signs for probably m is a perfect salary slot for a midseason acquisition someone will want a highupside young player in exchange for an older player that no longer fits their plans kerr could bench jk until then and hed still have the same upside everyone in the league knows the warriors have misused him the only thing that could hurt his perceived value at this point is an injuryif they cant find a trading partner that can pay the price they want then why trade his value wont get any lowerhe always has the option of signing his qo or getting an offer from another team hes not under contact their current reported asking price is just unrealisticthats what everyone says until its done this whole sub said that no one was going to pay jimmy butler his extension until someone didno you heathen we repeat the same jokes like good lil bots you apostate you defiler be gonethat was despite two timelines kumingamoodywiseman played pretty much no mins that runhindsight tbf thats like saying what if cavs took giannis in neither were realistic options at the timeits stephs primethis was my point exactly they depress his value in the hopes of keeping him on a cheap contract which is an open secret in the league gil on gils arena brings it up every time the warriors come up in discussion he bid his time when he tried to fight for more opportunity last year they slammed him in the media so he sat quietly and now finally has at least a modicum of leveragethe funniest thing was him getting dnps through the first round then getting starter minutes and promptly being our best scorer when we got the curry injuryyeah sure but the point isnt that the warriors did something wrong its that they havent done anything to earn any kind of loyalty from him theyve done the oppositehe was a lottery pick they asked him to be some kind of role player with the shortest leash same for wisemanthey didnt have any game to adapt because they didnt get to develop any gamehe can play with curry what he cant play with is with another like wiggins or jimmyreaves signed cheap because he wanted to be in la kuminga has told your fo straight up he doesnt wanna be there and he wants his moneyi hate the lakers as much as the next guy but this comp aint it chief reaves wanted to be a laker all the wayits hilarious how much ptsd rnba still has that theyll bend over backwards to get upset at some nonsensethe nets dont want thomas but will keep him if the price makes sense how is that different from the warriors they dont want kuminga but if hes cheap enough theres no reason not to keep him if for no other reason other than to eventually trade him and yeah kuminga isnt much of an asset but he is an asset the warriors arent in a position to be picky theyve been criticised for the two timelines approach and not going all in at the end of currys prime and now theyre doing just that by squeezing as much as they can out of whatever assets they have at the end of the day neither side here is under any obligation to help each other warriors have no reason to do kuminga any favors and kuminga has no reason to take a paycut for a team he doesnt even want to play for ultimately it comes down to which side has more leverage and whether or not someone is willing to pay kuminga theyre basically holding him ransomhes a restricted free agent theyre only doing what theyre supposed to dothat doesnt matter the other teams are only getting him at a negotiated price are you paying me less for my guitar because i dont use itthats irrelevant to how much other teams want kuminga and unless kuminga is willing to take the qualifying offer thats all that mattersind and okc werent immensely better until years later trying to insinuate it was just because they traded pg is a stretch to say the least indiana was barely better for years before they were really bad for years before becoming actually good okc was worse the next season then tanked for seasons and wasnt better until years after trading pg lac were basically the same this year as last with less win and knocked out in the first round and this season is yet to be seen how the old folks home will betrue i dont exactly know the weight that verbal agreements have within the league but i do know that breaking them is a major risk in terms of perception across the league im just saying if i was a player or agent id want it done especially as free agency continues and more and more teams are done making moves making all they moves they can with the new apron rules no one wants to be the last guy out on the musical chairs that is free agencydamn chill lmaowellas a human being ive developed a certain trait where i can understand anothers perspective try it some time lmaoooo i said bad wordso no leverage for non max player years of being bad to accrue assets and lottery picks or so years of being st or second round exits before being a true contender is pretty reasonable youre just too impatient in no way should any team be farm teams for perennial contenders and big market teams just to make you happywe just had small market teams in the finalsyou say this like the spurs have a bleak future rather than an incoming years of top bracket playoff seedsyou dont the player could sign a qo and not take the max wait a year and go where they wantyes because poor little sa struggles so bad to put together good teams and win titleslol get outta hereyeah the spurs are notorious for wasting lottery picks lets move them to vegas already so they can actually succeed rings in years between duncan and kawhi is just some amateur small market shitunlike all those big market teams that draft a generational player and immediately start winning titles like uhhave you considering moving to baseball so you can fulfill your apparent wish of watching farm teams develop future hall of famers just to have them called up to bigger teams as they get good instead of ruining the nba by condensing it to half a dozen real teams that youll graciously allow to sign good playersplenty of jobs have stipulations about where you have to work what are you talking aboutbecause being an nba player isnt like any other job how is it relevant how other jobs work other jobs dont pay the same eitheri agree man the salary cap already takes so much money from these guys its crazy that these young men have to spend at least years somewhere they dont want to beyeah the comment i responded to was talking about eliminating rfa which would leave ufa to allow guys to get paid and go where they want i was pointing out how people will upvote that and say its fair in a vacuum but then when a player like durant actually does it fans go apeshitthe point was durant got paid and went where he wanted to but people still hate him for itbut he went where he wanted and people hate him for it im just pointing out that let guys go where they want is not something nba fans actually believeyou could make the qo higher but it probably doesnt stop this unless you set it at an astronomical amount and then that just creates other problemsfranchise tags in the nfl only work on stars teams lose guys all the time coming off rookie contracts but its fine because the player market is so much more fluid in the nfland make it so you can st your player and take back as much as you send out thats the issue here even if the warriors could get a team to pay him m they can only take m back meaning they have to get a m player worth what kuminga is worth and while those players do exist theyre coveted as underpriced playersthe warriors know kuminga doesnt want to be there they dont want to keep him they just want to get a return on a player they hate i think thats bs if its clear neither party wants each other then kuminga should be allowed to walk this hostage situation is garbageits not exactly the same position they play i mean i wouldnt want to start them together but i wouldnt have a nice stagger for a team looking to lose games nothing but upside herenaw at m is an overpay much rather have kuminga at cool theorythere is always a biter even if the team dnpcds him everyone knows the reason for the dnp and there is always a gmcoach that think they can do better in coaching him upbut thats my point warriors view him as a bench guy and want a frp a young player for him which does not equate to a bench scorer like how they use him i dont get itnot that he couldnt crack the rotation that makes it sound like he was bad or unplayable he just wasnt meshing with our guys and we were winning games so it didnt make sense to try to jam him back in the rotation after he came back from injury if it happened earlier in the season kerr would have done more experimenting but we didnt have the timesteph has years max warriors are playing chicken and jk has nothing but time it seemsdespite the reputation in here im still kinda surprised how few people recognize it as a negotiation tactic its pretty basic stuff suns just did this with kd and got back less than they were asking for yet everyone acting like the warriors fo is incompetent for asking for a frp and a player curious what these people think the appropriate move is kuminga is ass anyone please just take him off our hands for the low we beg of youwhat if they are not happy with any offers hahaother teams know gsw are pushed in a corner hereif i am jk and his agent i am thinking thingsif we stay this will be a dark future for jk having control what team takes him personally i think the best for jk is take the qo and hope for the best as a ufabecause his current like mil cap hold will be gone and we use whatever we can to fill out the roster the core of jimmy steph and dray showed in the second half of the season that they are capable of winning games and the hope is that the continued growth of podz moody and post can help with the winning ppl like to downplay it but the warriors were basically in playoff mode since after the all star break last year now was that a cause of our own fault yes but the vets showed they still got a lot in them to push us the hope is with a full season of jimmy we continue to be one of the better teams in the league and just see how it goes in the playoffs with everyone healthyit doesnt they are doing crap by the player and they wont get anything out of itthe qo is tradeable in midseason noand if as a warrior you want him to get to m for a midseason acquisition why dont you offer that to him outrightbecause then they lose him for nothing the next year like that person said maybe they bring kuminga back on the qo next year but hell be a bad locker room presence and they lose a talented guy for nothinglike im sure they could get one of the reported draft pick good young player and no bad contracts maybe even two of those in the right circumstances and that would still be good value but i dont see them achieving all three for kumingathere were teams that would have extended he just told them he wouldnt agree memphis was one off the top of my head and so that trade never happenedimagine if they took anyone out of the top other then wisemanat least pre draft there was some potential halliburton gsw buzzhow is trading kuminga wasting stephs primetheyre trying to get a good player now to play with steph what should they do insteadhes just not that goodlol its not an open secret kerr doesnt want to play him thats the dumbest idea to not maximize a good player while hes cheap during your best chances of winning a titlekuminga is a good player hes just an awful fit in kerrs system and views himself as a future star instead of buying into the role the team has for himarenas is an idiot trying to stay relevant listening to his show for minutes should tell you everything you needyeah its almost as if its fucking easy to give a guy shots per game when your number one offensive option is not playingi cant believe you people are still parroting this nonsense that somehow kuminga has been held backneither side has any reason to be loyal to each other its a business the notion that the warriors owe him any respect or that kuminga owes the warriors any loyalty is asininewhat does being a lottery pick have to do with anything the coach is telling you what he wants from you do it earn playing time and expand your game the warriors dont need him running isos a game missing shots and turning the ball over times because his handle is poor and hes trying to get to the free throw linebe a star role player then be a starwe tried to feature wiseman on offense for an entire half of a season and he was awful but please continue pretending like you watched those gamesit is not the fault of the coach that jk is not better than wiggins or jimmyor drayyeah lakers had no problem playing reaves in big spots and relying on him reaves rewarded that trustsometimes he feels like his only friend is the city he lives in the city of angels who he just declined an extension fromim not saying he doesnt like la but he signed cheap because no other team made an offer which is exactly whats happening to kuminga only difference is he hasnt taken the deal yetand if the spurs would have made the offer he would have wanted to be a spur all the waythey just hate usunless theres something that hasnt been reported i dont think any team has made offers to the nets for cam thomas so its not just that the nets dont want him its that no other team really seems to either and maybe part of that is because hes an rfa and so they dont want to bother making an offer or maybe its just because teams dont seem to have an interest in himwith kuminga there have been multiple teams that have provided concrete offers to the warriors for an st that theyve rejected are you paying me less for my guitar because i dont use itif i have knowledge you dont even use your guitar im totally going to bring that up to haggle the price downthe only way you are getting more for your guitar is someone else outbidding meif i know the guitar you dont use is causing dysfunction in your house yesi didnt say it happened overnight but youre acting like okc is not in the situation they are directly because they traded pg for sga jalen williams and a boatload of additional assetslike just because that payoff took a few years to build up the connection between the trade haul and their current asset stash is not blatantly obviousi am very obviously not saying that the loss of pg made them a better team the next day its what they were able to turn his salary or trade package into which was consistently in excess of what those teams would have gotten out of him were he to remain putyea and i know what its like being lebron bc i read reddit and have a parasocial relationship with his ig storiesthe leverage would be the ability to sign with another teamthats already half of someones career i feel like there should be some middlegroundwtf we have many other different leagues to compare to the nba is the only league with rfa which inhibits an employee from going to his desired employer it should be eliminated all togetherand rightfully sodont look at my flairyeah because he joined the most stacked team and made the nba boring for two whole years because of it it was a bitch move and anyone else of his caliber wouldve also been hated for doing the same thingbut people still hate him for it they hate him because of the team he decided to join youre purposely not providing full context on why fans hate his moveyou could make the qo of the cap and make it so the player can choose whether its a year dealteams still get to keep their young stars who would anyway be commanding upwards of of the cap but cant hold players they dont value hostageallowed to walk to where has anyone actually made an offer for him then kuminga should be allowed to walkso screw contracts maybe the warriors dont want him because he doesnt want to be herenaw is a great role a player shoots plays good defense even ran some sets in the playoffs kumingas offense is still a big question mark at this pointlet me ask you this suppose that youre a team willing to offer jk in the ballpark of myear would you rather make him an offer sheet in that range forcing the warriors to match at which point hes not tradeable until the winter at least go to the warriors and negotiate a signandtrade when the warriors have broadcasted that while they only offer jk myear and therefore thats what they value him they want in exchange a rp a good prospect no bad contracts which will be necessary to salary match since one rp and a good prospect do not amount to even the m in the qo shuffle some players around and free enough cap space so that you can make jk an offer that the warriors are unable to match looks like m for the first year would probably do itto me the second option makes no sense whatsoever for the other team if i really want jk ill go for the third option and just make sure i get him if i am unwilling to make that offer sheet i am certainly not going to the warriors and trading a first round pick a good prospect so basically first rounders one of which has already conveyed and additional rightvalue contracts to salary matchthey arent going to bench jimmy or draymond for him and his shot isnt good enough to play alongside bothto some teams he would absolutely be a starter he also doesnt do the things kerr wants from him and has been called out for looking off a wide open steph multiple timeskerr said in his postseason presser that if jk is back they will try to make it work with all of them jk wasnt very good after the ankle injury and the warriors needed every win to try and avoid the playin maybe if they were committed to being a playin team they would have worked harder to integrate him with jimmy but their stars are old and risking your season on a single game isnt smarti doubt they think they can get a good young player and a st for him if they get offered either of those they are happy enough with i wont be shocked if thay price comes down to just of thosehe would be a starter on a younger less aspirational team with a loose system lolyou would like steph to have years maxsteph does not have years max lol he made nd team all nba this seasonthey want the warriors to start off negotiations by asking for a bag of chips and cash considerationsthe qo is super risky for jk too though he could get hurt or play bad and screw up any chance at a good contract plus most likely kerr will still see him as a nonwinning player and keep him in the doghouse which would also screw over his chances for more money thats why hes in no rush to sign the qo the warriors also dont want him to sign the qo because then he has a ntc plus even if he were to agree to a trade hed be on such a small salary that they wouldnt be able to get much of anything backno the qo comes with a no trade clause hes allowed to waive it i believe but only would if he liked the destination i assume my hunch is they did offer him around and hes trying to get more and more importantly to get out by fishing for signandtrades its very unlikely to work because the warriors would want to get a player they like more and that player needs to be on a contract for half as much very few roleplayers making m that would plug into the gs system almost impossible to find someone who would provide more value for the first half of the season so it would have to be someone they felt was a surebet playoffrotation playerkuminga has way more to lose taking the qo than the warriors so gsw likely doesnt expect him and his agent to take that optioncouldve been worse couldve been killian hayeskerr loved him i think both bob kerr were against drafting wiseman after he worked out for them but lacobs overruled them he loved wiseman for some reasondo it now and not dick around all summer while they are still people availablebut better than theyre trying to pay himgreat mindset to recruit prospects to your franchise beyond thrilled that you guys have embraced this mindset tbhnah reaves has stated flat out that he wants to be a laker for life he even went thru the draft undeclared because he wanted to be in the purple and gold hes taken discounts because our fo has believed in him and hell be rewarded with a bigger contract soon enough if yall treated kuminga like we do reaves he wouldnt be unhappy rn thats the differencenope lakers would have matched that offerreaves was a player in demand but yet teams didnt offer a sheet for himkuminga is not in demand that muchconcrete are you jsut saying that cause shams used it as a buzz word cause no one knows what actually is being offered its no diff than the suns with durant and beal beal had a no trade clause so why didnt the suns honor it and trade him for scraps to his preferred destination now yes the suns eventually bought him out but that was after a long saga in itself same with kd kd was being kd and wanted out im sure not many suns fans are happy that to get kd yall have like first rounders mikail bridges who went for first rounders himsef and cam who just went for mpj so of course nothing is equivalent but kd basically was worth first rounders of them unprotected from your suns alone bridges and cammpj the return you guys got for kd is as dillon brooks and jalen greenthe nfl hasnt gotten rid of restricted free agencylet me introduce you to mlb where teams can control a player for years before they become a free agentthe nhl has rfa as wellwas gonna go after this dude but you already summarized it perfectlydeletedbrother i was just explaining why the other guy mentioned durant even though durant wasnt an rfa read the whole comment chain before replying lmaoshouldnaw is pretty much locked into his role as the th man on a cotender though good and d player that needs to reply on other offensive players kuminga still has that upside you can bet on and at worst projects as a th man scorer off the benchthe team didnt offer him myr the qo is a standard process that every team goes through to apply the rfa status on their players they most likely offered him a salary slot in the m range that would net them a better player midseason but the warriors are willing to do a st right now if the terms blow them away so that is the asking price midseason the expectations may change they may just be looking for solid role playersperhaps a trade like jk to the pistons for levert and reed or any other combination of players that add up to mnow if jk accepts the qo and gets a ntc then that screws over the warriors not much out there that is worth m besides rookies and end of bench players in that scenario they would have to package other players in trades to make up the differencethe qo is not an actual offer they are reportedly trying to sign him in the m rangebut a team like that would never give up their frp and a young prospect for that right thats literally what they would be hoardingthe risk of staying long term is basically not growing as a player since you dont playi know the warriors dont want that but at this point jk is probably mad at themlol hows he gonna get hurt when they dont play him since adding jimmy to their team he already turned down their bigger offers last year and relations have gotten much worse since then and his fit even worse my money is him taking that qo and just dictating where he wants to next off season itll be best for his career and future earnings versus taking some small deal and continue to rot on the warriors benchthey did offer him around and hes trying to get more and more importantly to get outyou mean the warriorsif the warriors offered him why isnt the qualifying offer at that price point what would be the warriors incentive in offering him more but not officiallyyeah id agree thats their current thinking otherwise they wouldnt be asking for so much in a trade well see if it pays off i guessor patrick williamshonestly killian was better than wiseman and his deficiencies would have been better hidden in gswwe can only afford hortford on the mle and melton an a minimum and whatever we get back from a st from kuminga so we should rush and take less for that last one to help stephs primehes not m aav goodis he though no one in the league seems to want to pay him more than mil when he refused a mil contract last yearno one has made an offerthunder win one asterisk ring and the fans talking about franchise mindset lolplayers go where the money and fame is no team has ever been rewarded for doing right by the players thats why the draft is importantthe lakers were limited in what they could offer reaves for whatever reason nobody thought it was worth offering more and seeing if he took the money or stayed in lathat they would have matched is the pointconcrete meaning that there were actual offers made by both the suns and the kings for kuminga and if the warriors had said yes then the trade would have been completed and thats been reported by multiple sources not just shamsthe issue with beal was that no team wanted him we would have loved to send him where he wanted to go but no team wanted him on that contracttotally fair i didnt even know the nfl had restricted free agency seems like it rarely happens and if it does its not for a notable player it should be eliminated too workers should have the right to work wherever they want as long as its within their contractno players are allowed to go where they want regardless of how we feel about it we the public are allowed to form opinions on players based on their actions regardless of rules this is how the world works its not that deeplol just because people hate durant for his decision doesnt mean he didnt literally go to the team he wanted to play forpeople hating a player for making a free agency decision players not having freedom in free agencydurant can go anywhere he wants and i have the permission to say fuck you anytime i wantwhere he is allowed to take offers no one has made onewhat is it with people and not giving up on young warriors players its james wiseman all over againfour years in i think we need to be realistic about kuminga naw can be starting for an excellent team i still dont know who kuminga is on offenseyeah i think theyre signaling theyre not gonna trade him unless someone overpays theyd rather have him on a multiyear cheap deal to trade him at the deadline with picksplayers for more valueyeah jk wants money playing timethe ball and to be away from the warriors hes losing leverage as the day goes by though for getting all three of those thingshe still has to practice and just live life in general klay tore his achilles just scrimmaging in the summer away from the team not to mention hell get some minutes he wont be dnp all games next season my money is on he just signs whatever the warriors are really offering him versus what he actually wants so probably like moody level of money for a short deal guaranteed money and ufa asap there is just no rush for him to do so and he can play this game until the very last day as he knows the warriors dont want him taking the qo eitherthe qo set the starting point and triggers the rfa period and other conditions if he accepts if kuminga wants more from the warriors he has to give up something most notably more years of team control the next shortest offer gs could make is a player option which makes him a better trade asset to get that advantage theyd need to give him something eg money because their promises of improved rolemore playing time are not trustworthyin other words theyre still negotiating no point in them making subsequent offers official it just makes it easier for other teams to bid up the pricebut better than theyre trying to pay himcongrats on winning the al horford sweepstakeslakers treated kobe right and got lebron from thatthis is kuminga and his agents point as well though give him a couple years of a starter role on a rebuilding team see what he can really look like with mpgkuminga is years old just because he doesnt fit well with the warriors does not mean this is it for him nba players dont reach their peak until around naw on the other hand is and closer to his ceiling as a player hes a great player but the nba pays players with a high ceiling more than guys with a high floorhe is not getting playing time or the ball regardless ifnhe signs because that doesnt fit the warriors play cant blame kerr because he is right but cant blame kuminga for wanting out as wellhes spoken with the kings front office and really liked when he heard significant minutes being a massive part of the team a guaranteed starting position all of that is more valuable to him than long term than rotting away on the warriors bench cause hes gotta think about the next contract too his value may even be worse hes seen how bad its dropped since just last off seasondo you have sources or are you just guessing because given how strained the relationship between jks camp and the warriors seems to be i struggle to see how it could be in boths best interest to keep this unofficial offer secretzoom out a little they got lebron because theyre the los angeles lakers be real the biggest stage for the biggest player celtics didnt pay it portland didnt give a shit where dame wanted to go spurs ignored lmas trade request rockets didnt trade hakeem to seattle lakers didnt trade kobe the list goes on and on teams and players treat each other right when its convenient the moment their goals dont align loyalty and respect go out the window the whole player empowerment thing started specifically because teams dont do right by players and nowadays neither do players do right by teams again its a business you just watched the jazz ignore ace baileys opinon and draft him against his wishesi am of the opinion that has not shown nearly enough to warrant getting a chance to be the guy he has been on a team that has been decently competitive since he got there and has not meshed in the system at all hes very streaky and his efficiency fell off a cliff this year i think its super concerning that gs doesnt want to bring him back when they still see themselves as semicontenders and would also be planning for a post steph futurein a couple of years we are talking about a year old who has been in the league for years if youre going to be a star i think we should be pretty confident years in i dont think theres a single big star right now that we werent pretty confident about this far into their careeri dont know that kumingas ceiling is that high i think thats been the main disagreement ive had with people on this thread i think there is a role for kuminga in the league as a role player i only think that can happen if plays more off ball and accepts that he wont be one of those players who dominates that ball and is running lots of isos every gameyeah i know thats why he wants a sign and trade it doesnt sound like the warriors truly want one with their high asking price and turning down the kings and suns offers they want him on a good deal that is fully used in a trade by the deadline a st only allows them to bring back half his salarybut will that offer stand by next offseason especially if he gets hurt or does worse this season idk who is or can be available next year so no guarantee the kings wait for him that long with the exact same promises they gave now he knows hes gonna rot on that bench if he takes the qo offerim guessing the amount they offered based on what comparable players got recently most of what i wrote here is just the facts of how this process works theres a really good analysis piece here just like to see some more data i think its a fair complaint for kuminga to make that despite being in the league for years it was in a system he didnt mesh with with a team environment that didnt emphasize his strengths and a role he wasnt comfortable filling its entirely possible that if he does get the chance hes a major disappointment but i think he wants to try and thats fairhe doesnt need better than just a role player i mean youre comparing him to naw at m a year naw is a bench player who couldnt start for the wolves is years older and has worse counting stats with similar minutes to kuminga kuminga is definitely worth m a year just not m a year like he wantshes rotting on that bench regardlessim guessing the amount they offered based on what comparable players got recentlywhat players rfa qualifying offers are rare scenarios overall are you talking about the cam thomas giddey and grimesits only been four years for kuminga the way i phrased it was not good so my fault on thati do think the warriors would be a system where most guys could thrive i think jimmy coming over and doing so well didnt make kuminga look good at all i just dont believe that he can be effective if hes your number one guy maybe someone rolls the dice thoughi dont think naw not starting is an indictment on him he wasnt going to displace ant or jaden mcdaniels for their starting spots he has worse counting stats than kuminga but i think hes definitely a better player if i am going to pay million for a guy that i have to win a title with im picking naw over kuminga everytime right now guys like cam johnson josh hart aaron gordon alex caruso are in that million range i dont think kuminga will ever be as good as some of those guys maybe josh hart but i wouldnt bet on him ever being as good as the other three based on what i have seenat least with a warriors deal hell be paid more and can most likely get out by february instead of apriljune depending on how well the season goes for the warriorsthanks for clarifying no problem yeah im curious to see what happens i hope he gets the chance to try because he doesnt look like hed be happy as a role player or th mani disagree contracts have to evaluated based on their entire length not just next season its naive to think a year old player wont grow their game and become better each season nba players typically peak at all those other people you listed are except cam johnson who will be their contracts are worth less because on the tail end youre paying a year old m theyll get worse every season as they age kuminga is more valuable because he will be entering his athletic prime at the end of his next long term contract hell get better every season hes also already improved his game each season so its not a stretch to think it will continuecam thomas is a great comparison theyre in very similar positions in terms of contract negotiations the main difference is thomas is a guard and kuminga is a wing wing players in the nba are more valuable right now than guardsi think his defense will always give him a spot in the league but this point im out on him being a star i do think its a mentality thing for him and accepting that he wont always have the ball if he can do that then he could be a starter on a very good teamrough way for me to find out josh hart is that old also caruso just got extended i think a better example here is santi aldama same draft class and two years apart he got million a year i dont think jk is that level of player right now and i dont think hes worth a gamble that is that much more than thatbut generally its rare for guys to take a huge leap in their development this far in honestly kuminga reminds me a lot of jalen green they extended him for over million and it really didnt pan out guys who develop bad habits dont really get out of them that oftenkuminga fell out of the rotation this season he didnt play against houston until jimmy was out i think its telling that they traded for jimmy and then he just didnt playcam thomas is a different situation because he plays in a way that isnt valued at all anymore no one really wants score first guards who dont do much elsei couldnt believe caruso was i feel like he was just drafted by the lakers a few seasons agoi would agree that aldama is also a good comparison i value kuminga more due to his age and athleticism but its not unreasonable to pick aldama but to that point aldama signed an m extension so m for a similar player would make sense especially on a longer term contractjalen green is a bad example because hes only you cant really say he hasnt taken the leap until much later in his careerkuminga did not fall out of the rotation he was injured and missed games near the end of the season he came back at the very end of the regular season and had trouble adjusting to the new roster he was dnped in the playoffs not regular season if the warriors bring him back he will definitely be in the rotation and have time to mesh with the new rosteri think i am just much more pessimistic about player development i know guys develop in the league but four years in you have to show something i think that this next part applies more to jalen green but you need to have shown some elite nba skill by this point and i dont know if these guys have million feels like a lot to bet on someone as unproven as kuminga at least in my opinion i dont feel that ive seen the growth from either of these guysi dont disagree as a warriors fan watching kumingas development has been frustrating but nba gms think about it differently theyd rather take a chance on a high upside young wing unless youre contendingwin now mode so those type of players get bigger contracts than they might be worth one of the main reason the warriors dynasty happened was because steph became a superstar while on a team friendly deal thats what every gm is hoping when they sign a young player do i think kuminga will become a star player no but he has the athleticism and the hope would be he proves people like us wrong and takes a large leap in the next few seasons you dont have that opportunity with a year old player they are what they are or worse as they agei do agree that the upside is obviously more than the average player with kuminga with jalen green i just think that he has no bbiqa quick follow up to this i think that as fans we are much more susceptible to believing in super athletic guys like jalen green and jonathan kuminga because of the fact that you cant teach physical traits we got really enamored by that stuff and think that you just have to teach this guy to be smarteri do think that fans overestimate the likelihood of developing the mental part of the game just because it seems like anyone should be able to even if stuff like that is described as intangibles a lot of people myself definitely included project players to develop these traits',\n",
       " 'its a different idea but its similar logic i think supermax players should get the supermax money but it should only count as a regular max cap hit it would allow naturally drafted big s to stay together but not allow them to keep the outrageous depth without smart gmingthis would just destroy the trade market imagine how many picks it would take for minnesota to trade ant if hes only counted as of his salarythis is a stupid idea but casual fans love such shit the cap exists for exactly two reasons keep annual salary costs within a limit keep parity by preventing teams from hoarding too much talentgiving a discount on drafted playerssupermaxes literally helps teams hoard talent and that instantly destroys parity if you thought dubs were dominant imagine them with even more cap space to sign more pieces or imagine okc having a lower salary and lower taxes than knicksyou realize that this sorta thing just rewards bottoming out for as long as possible and hoarding draft picks right the best value contracts right now are rookie max level after rookie if the player is a true star and multiyear deals you can get when you have a ton of negotiating power like converting ways or the stuff morey did with covington these all come from the same thing and it is already advantageous enoughthe only discount thing that makes sense to me is the whole supermax only counting as a regular max for the cap for player that you drafted but the goal of that is more to create a natural competitive ebb and flow forcing teams to acquire a star in the draft before trying to win a title but this isnt perfect since sga and hali wouldnt count even though i think most would consider them homegrownroster continuity is obviously good for the league and the league is at its best when teams build through the draft but i dont see how you can reward it without ruining parity drafting well is already its own reward but to reward it further i think you have to distinguish it from drafting high and having a lot of picks and i dont see how to its too subjectivecamara was drafted by the sunsthese ideas just dont work because of the cba revenue split it may not count against a teams cap but it will bloat player salary above the split and force every player to return salary yeahno thunder dont need an advantage like thatcamara was a suns pick yeah he never played for them but technically if you gave the blazers his discount then youre rewarding the blazers for the suns picking well which makes no sense youre rewarding the trade not the draft pick if you expanded it to players who have spent or more years with the same team then it might make sensei get the want to keep all players but then wed have a no fun league where okc has super duper stars because they got a ton of picks and then who cares about the season because the good team is just going to win i love all the offseason movesit would never be agreed upon or implemented because it would punish big market teams that rely more heavily on fa you have to be realisticnow if we said that after playing for a franchise for x years your all nba franchise player will have their salary count y less towards the salary capthen yeah i can see thati even think this should be a career long thing so that encourages lost sons to come homethis would require the nba to fix accurate recording of draftnight trades and team selections which they should do anywaythe idea of these super maxes and maxes in general is to avoid super teams from joining together eg lebron and bosh going to the heat superstars in general are underpaid comparative to other players to impact ratioi think the thing is op is only thinking about the happy scenario ie good management drafts a good player and build a good team but what if a good player gets drafted by a terrible management say luka is on the pelicans or a drafted player gets worseinjury prone after signing the max say lavine gobert embiid it will be much harder to move themowners dont want it its simple as that they dont want the pressure of having to pay players more than theyd get elsewhere the current cba is functionally a hard cap for a reason the owners can point at the cba when the fan base is upset when teams arent kept togetheri hate to say this but you shouldnt be allowed to overpay guys without consequences just coz you drafted themthis is a bad idea the point of the second apron is to break up dynasties and increase league parity otherwise okc and premeltdown boston would be virtually unbeatable for the next decade id be a rerun of the lebronwarriors era in the sgreat for lebroncavs or warriors fans bad for everyone elsethe majority of owners arent going to want rules that make it easier for the gms to spend more moneyalready the team with the best player is most likely to win if supermax could count as the max i wonder if this would give a too large advantage over for teams with a top players in their rank but one change i would do is to look at the cap and threshold over a rolling years this way the planning would be over a three years period instead of one this would help when a player needs to jump quickly salary from rookie scale to max by example love this idea someone send to adam silveri think this is a great idea league office take notewhile im all for competitive balance it is really silly that teams that draft well cant keep their draft picks without being penalized and as you note it sucks as a fan to see players youve grown attached to end up leaving if theres a downside to this i cant see it great ideano thanks the spurs already have years of a generational advantage because they got the shot at a pick in wemby why do they need more advantageswhy are so many fans up in arms for this salary cap stuffthese sports athletes are already making millions of dollars and now even hundreds of millions so what they have to take less to win they still make more than of the fans let them take less to win or take the most and be stuck on teams with no depth smart teams will still find ways to win championshipyes it shouldtoo complicated it should be as simple assupermax contracts signed with their initial team only counts as a normal max into the cap if you traded for the contract then it counts fullyproblem solveddo this but for supermaxes onlyyeah honestly the more i thought about your idea op i think its correct because it scales too like it means less but still means something with the smaller scale contract guys but means a lot for the star players with big deals only thing i will say is i think going from is a little rich for my blood like i dont hate that number but i think would be more realistic in terms of what the league would consider reasonablemy idea is a stacking reduction in cap hit per year on the team say something like per year just to pick a number so by the time a rookie max deal kicks in its like off by the time a guy is hitting his prime hes around this allows for players that get drafted and wash out with bad teams to find a new team and revive their career a bit could do something larger that caps like per year but it caps at obviously i love rewarding teams that draft and develop their guys well but tying it to the team that drafts a player could punish guys who go to bad organizationsi would say do this for the longest tenured allstar on the each team too so for the kings sabonis salary would count as less for the capyeah thats where i basically got this idea from but i personally like my idea more because often fans love the not quite superstar players a lot as well but with just the supermax idea there is no extra incentive to keep those players with a clubis this not what op said in the very first sentence of his posti like the drafted supermax idea i just think there also needs to be levels for non drafted players to earn into long term loyalty for instance aaron gordon wasnt drafted by the nuggets like jokic or murray were but hes been there long enough to have earned fan loyalty so the nuggets should be allowed to get say a or cap relief discount on his contract after years of service drafted players should be i think supermax players should get the supermax money but it should only count as a regular max cap hitthis is basically giving the clippers and lakers an advantage in forming a big and not really helping anyone elsetheres gotta be a trade kicker though if they get tradedi dont think cap hit is fair i would prefer them to no count for the taxive been saying this since the supermax became a thing it makes zero sense it literally disincentivizes homegrown players from staying the way they have it set upit would also make salary matching harder say ant is making million but it only counts as million due to this percent for their cap space then the timberwolves have to take in million while giving out millionyou can say it counts as percent in trades but then that makes aprons and being hard capped more complicatedbut why would this be so bad im sure minnesota fans would be very happy if ant stayed a minnesotan for his career im sure ant would be happy if him staying in minnesota allowed the team to have more flexibility to make a good team around him like part of the goal here is to keep guys at their club if a player really wants out of course he can still go to another club but we want to incentivize good drafting but like i said maybe isnt the number and it should be that is for people with a better grasp of the numbers to figure outit would certainly make the trade market more difficult but not destroy it the entire point is to incentivize not just good drafting but well executed long term player development thats why the idea shouldnt just be for supermax contracts but for all players drafted by a clubpeople are so stuck in the early years of teams adapting this cba i really like this cba as a thunder fan it speeds up the turnover of players and picks and is more of a testament to gm asset management skillsif also very very very strongly incentivizes tanking like should this years pacers be at a structural disadvantage to the thunder simply because the thunder were bad and drafted two of their big while the pacers always put a competitive team out and smartly acquired their key assets outside the draftif this went into place the only competent way to team build becomes tanking vs under the current cba the reward for tanking has been greatly reducedits genuinely mindboggling how many ideas get proposed to address something thats an intended consequence in the first place literally the whole idea of a salary cap in the first place is to redistribute talent from the best teams to worse teamsso now that its doing exactly that we need to address itits the same deal as people proposing that qbs not count against the salary cap in the nfl like no having a qb of that caliber is already enough of a competitive advantage just like having true supermaxlevel players in the nba is already enough of a competitive advantagei dont know why suddenly this idea of if you draft well you shouldnt be punished for it is trending like tough luck the whole point is to prevent dominant dynasties that just ruin the league for a decade its even weirder when okc just won and look to be in the best spot for any recent champion with their young players and draft assets the cba thing wont even be a problem for them until i think or i heard someone say so they are supposed to win in a row and then still get to keep everyone great rule changecap spike was the cause of the warriors the cba itself was fine i dont know why people keep bringing them up it was a one time thingi think the number is too high but i agree with ops concept and think stupid is harsh for no reason like what if it was just still enough to matter and help teams who are burdened by having to overpay to keep their drafted guys but not so much where they get a competitive advantage for reference on a mill a year contact of that not counting towards the cap is just mill not a huge deal but would at least helpyes but he spend his rookie season playing for portland which is why i specifically included that type of language in the post to say it counts where a rookie plays the majority of their first season because in my eyes trades like that basically make the player drafted by the team he first plays for like kobe was drafted by the lakers even if he wasnt actually drafted by the lakersyes right now that would help the thunder the most except of course sga wouldnt be getting the cap reduction unless im mistaken because i think he spend his rookie year elsewhere but long term this would help small markets and good franchises the most making the championship much more about drafting well and less about being able to attract free agents it would allow teams like milwaukee more flexible capspace to build around giannis while making it so much more attractive for him to stay with the bucksrecency biasi guess i just dont value the off season moves as much as i value having a team i can fully identify with as a fan when i was a kid in the s early s it felt like players often had their team and they stuck with it ewing was the knicks reggie was the pacers jordan was the bulls players often only left their franchise at the very end of their career which i always hated back then too of course this still happens like with curry and gsw but it feels far more rare and it makes me care about the league less rivalries dont really feel as real anymore because players often arent on a team long enough for it to matter to mei want a return to the time where you could identify a player with a team because that helped me as a fan identify more with my team but yes okc right now has an insane draft capital so maybe this needs some delay but also even under the current system okc is looking very fortunate for the futurei see it as a disadvantage to non cash rich owners who arent going to want to spend over the cap in the first placeokay maybe its a bit unrealistic but in your example why does it have to be all nba players only as a fan i get attached to players couldnt we reward team and player loyalty even for the roleplayers it could even be a progressive system where after for example years every extra year reduces the cap by y honestly i am just not at all a fan of players constantly leaving or getting traded to play elsewhere i want to have a core of players i can grow lasting memories withno one is preventing you from keeping your draft picks youre merely prevented from hoarding talent if you draft bums you can sign all of them at cheap contracts and keep them if you sign huge talents the league rightfully doesnt want you to be able to carry multiple maxessupermaxesi really dont care what players make or what billionaires pay what i do care about is finding ways to identify with my club more i am a blazers fan and i enjoy following the same guys and identifying with those guys this change would incetivize both teams and players to try to keep their own together sure it would be great if superstars took paycuts to make more capspace for a better team but that is so rare so instead why not make it easier for teams to keep their drafted players making a drafted core better incomparison to just some legionaires at least bang for your buck wiseits funny how you are bashing on already rich athletes while in the same thread defending even richer billionairesthey have class solidarity they wont take sweetheart deals on principalok i like this general idea too im not sure if i like it more than mine because i do want drafting and picks to be more valuable but i think your idea adresses some issues mine might have it probably should be capped though or some superstars are going to be taking away way to small of a capspace but the general idea is good maybe a way for loyalty to be rewarded in addition to mine where a player can start to qualify if they have been somewhere for a certain time maybe even progressively more until he hits the same level as drafted playersyour idea would actually make those thth man types more valuable to keep around instead of just flipping them for assets teams might actually build some continuity instead of constantly churning the bottom of the roster is insanity okc x on their max contracts gives them more than enough for quality playersi wrote that when i was sleep deprived my bad i forgot to add the other part of my ideawhen a player on said supermax gets traded it does a switch and the supermax is the cap hit and the player gets paid a regular max it would disincentivise players from wanting to get traded as well as disincentivse trading for stars that are not worth it i give like a soft ntc and would bring back free agency as a real idea and make cap space more valuable againno it doesnt what supermax players are leaving in free agencyi would assume this rule only applies the rule to original team and therefore would make it the exact opposite but equally as impossible because of it wolves hypothetically sending out a mil player but cam only take back mil therefore making the other team have a requirement of being mil under the apron to qualify as a trade partner or they have to send the wolves back mil more than they have space just sounds like hell for the cap guystrade matching numbers can be adjusted in a cba it could be designated that the players outgoing incoming value are the same with the pay bump for the new team just applying to the cap after the tradejust put in language that supermaxes are only payable by the team that offers them and the player takes a paycut that reverts to regular max if tradedi think itd make the rich get richer drafting a star would be so advantageous for roster building it would probably become a prerequisite to winning a championship i like how theres more than one way to build a contender even if it does tend to favor certain marketsmeh i dont think its crazy people would like to see players they like stay on their teams longer not even shorter it might be more fair but its kinda crazy how few franchise players there are at this point in all of sportsexactly fans of teams that are being affected by it now are pissed but thats shortsighted the same things that are hurting them now during the adjustment period will help them when their cap sheet is in order and there is more talent availablethe cba and aprons arent perfect imo but they are doing what they are supposed to its just going to take time for teams to adjustits not inconceivable that fans of individual team have different needs and wants than the whole league thoughthe thunder are fine for but run into problems in when chet and jdubs extensions kick in and especially in when shais supermax kicks innot the dubs the post kd dubs having extra cap space because of home grown talents is just a bad leagueits stupid because any notion of a salary discount goes against the reason for the cap to exist as it is its something that is a nonstarter entirelyif the cap gets changed in such a big way it wont be something like op said it will be a hard capkobe and luka were draft day trades its not the same at allyou are acting like the league is dominated by big market teams and small market teams are getting screwed over no dude the league is at its best place in terms of that the top this season included indy okc and the wolves last season we also had indy and wolves before that denver just won the bucks won years before that i dont get the idea of helping small markets more when evidently they are just fine and they are the best teams in the league right now okc looks like the champion with the best ever future considering their ages and assets no one moves in the fa these days to big markets for the bucks thing they absolutely should not be allowed more to build around giannis they had their run they paid middleton big money kept him and he fell off so they lost him for free they traded away a lot to get jrue which later helped them build a championship team then they traded jrue and a bunch of stuff to get dame which didnt work out they went all in to win they won then failed made mistakes i am sorry but they are done they should have done better you cant have your cake and eat it tooyeahno id rather teams have to build in multiple ways thunder dont need this bone it will turn into years of absolute boredom which probably will happen anyways but a team like that doesnt things to become easier especially cosndiering how many picks they own thats also not fair my teamothers trade all these picks not thinking they are as valuable as they are n suddenly a new rule is made that draft picks salaries get slashed by thats not fair we didnt get to plan for that so your plan would at least have to start in what we really should be discussing is the wheeled draft before this cause i dont think its fair small markets get to ruin the product by tanking and get rewarded with top picks every year everyone should get equal stakes if your making a rule like that around draftingwhen i was a kid in the s early sfrom the s to the mid s teams won like percent of the titles then two more teams won the majority of the remaining titles what you are hoping for is in direct opposition to the parity everyone claims to likecause the all nba guy typically has the largest contract you reduce the implications of his contract you make it significantly easier to keep the more expensive roleplayers around him but yeah you could hypothetically do it for roleplayers as wellyour solution is to draft bad playersthese people will agree with you as soon as their favorite player gets traded away for nothingyes this is what i want i dont just care about the star i like my role players toook like i said im open to the number being lower im not a numbers guy i just want an incentive for players and teams to stick together where possiblecould also do something like for the first of the cap for the next this would mean if a player earns of the cap and got drafted by the team you gain a reduction in salary vs the capa player that earns of the cap only gets a reductioncould also do a solution like for the st player for the nd player for the rd or something to not make it extremei really like the overall idea and i think there are enough solutions to potential problems to make it workyeah thats a bit different thats an interesting take for sure dunno if the players union would go for it though or the teams themselves lol but i like the idea anywaycan we stop talking about trading ant now i seriously doubt players would agree to thati think drafting a star is already a huge plus anyway but yes i do want teams to focus more on the draft because as a fan there is nothing i love more than seeing a guy spend his whole career at my clubdrafting a star is essentially already a prerequisite to winning a championshipokc drafted chet and jdub and sga was a baby when they traded for himboston drafted tatum and browndenver drafted jokic and murraygolden state drafted steph draymond and klaymilwaukee drafted giannis and middletonyou have to go back to the lakers to find a team that didnt have a drafted star and even then the only reason they got ad was because they traded a bunch of very good homegrown players for himthey get moved because they arent good enough this happens in every cba i dont get the fuss about this particular onethats way too dramatic and no it doesnt this simply rewards teams for being good at drafting its not really fair that a team could do everything right and hit on a guy in a draft and when it comes time to sign him theyre penalized by having to give them the super max something that teams who did none of the work to draft and develop that player would have to pay that is literally punishing the team for being good at draftingits the same in the sense he literally never played a real game for the team that drafted h himi get that and maybe its true it would need a delayed start but odds are im still going to be an nba fan in so i could accept that if it could help the longterm health of the game the question about tanking is something fundamental that is just as relevant right now but i think a bit outside the scope of this discussioni think this is a bit too much i like teams having to choose between a third star or depth and that choice actually having consequences if they make the wrong one depending on the situationoh so sort of a progressive anti tax where the poorest players in quotation because none of them are poor get the most relative relief that sounds like an awesome idea it also encourages teams further to stay loyal to the lower class of players that they currently couldnt care less about great ideathis would result in a huge increase in tanking the value of a top pick skyrockets so teams will desperately go after them you would have to adjust the lottery system as wellthats why i say the rich would get richer they would have another added advantage on top of that champions built in fa would be near impossibleyou literally just said this one speeds that process up though when casual fans already wanted it slowed down misguided or nota team could do everything right and hit on a guy in a draft ignores the fact that the majority of stars picked in the draft come from getting lucky in the lottery and picking highdid dallas do everything right to get cooper flagg or did they just luck into getting the first pickthis proposal makes drafted talent even more important which heavily rewards tanking which is already quite importantit doesnt matter though because decision makers are smart enough to realize that this would destroy parity in the league this isnt happeningyou can pay alll your guys just go into the second apronwhat you want is to be able to hoard talent multiple maxes while getting a discount for it that sounds fucked and goes completely against the league structure the league salary cap the draft is designed for parity not to reward teams for drafting wellwhy should teams that make smart drafting decisions be rewarded but teams that make smart trades and free agent signings be penalizedgetting moved the same day vs spending a summer with a team are very different experiences someone like zhaire smith has no experience of being on the sunsi mean the thing about it is teams like us planned around what we did before to keep on digging deeper in the future so its hard to really have an end date to where this rule wouldnt fuck someone like us given our strategy suns are planning on trading our picks to build around booker still and remain competitive within the next year n we might have never have put ourselves in that position if we had knew a rule like that was coming back in its just a massive curveball pretty much it heavily rewards teams who have already planned around draft n screws teams like us who planned on free agency so there is a flip side to this that i find inherently unfair given how heavily some teams have already committed to said strategies team building is more than an even a year process has to do with tanking becoming even more prevalent than it is adding more incentive than it already has u want something like this u must eliminate the incentive thus wheeled draftyesespecially since higher paid players are more likely to find a home somewhere else since they should be in general better playerswhile more niche roleplayers that would not find a team can stay on with their current team for a lower cap hitokay but youre saying all this about parity but its literally not parity right now because currently the team that drafts these guys is punished for being good at drafting thats the point its not an even playing field because you have to fuck your cap significantly more if youre the team smart enough to draft starsuperstar players vs a team that trades or signs them and did none of the workinvestment to get them to the point where theyre a star so thats complete bullshit because its not even as it currently stands and if its gonna favor one side or the other it should favor the team that made the draft pick and developed the player or make it completely even and let everyone do the supermaxthey arent penalized theyre paying the normal max for these players thats the point this isnt swapping one penalty for another teams that acquire max guys through trade or fa have no punishment at all its only teams that draft guys and have to pay the super max that are punished it should be the other way around you should have a small incentivereward for drafting and developing players when it comes time to sign big contractsyeah but at some point you just have to accept that not everything is fair all the time seven years ago teams didnt know the second apron was coming and that has enormous influence on team building as well and honestly i think the suns are going to be in a bad spot regardlessexactly n thats why the nd apron was bullshit they needed to give a year warning you want this idea cause u want it to be fair for your team so i can say that right back at you the small markets have been given enough make do with what u have the entire system has been designed for yall alreadyalso your opinion what the suns will be is meaningless the point is they committed to a strategy n suddenly u want a curveball thrown at teams like us to bolster your own small markets thats bullshit everything is catered to you already the nd apron and supermax contracts were created for your markets specifically now you just want to keep adding on so actually its not just about being fair its you being greedyi dont want it because its fair to my team i want it because i want teams to be back to having stronger identities i hate how much players move around i dont blame them or the teams under the current system but i think it makes the general fan experience worse thats why i want this change i doubt the blazers are winning a chip anytime soon anywaythe general small market fan yeah most ppl are fans of big markets so actually it hurts most fans player movement is a good thing it creates parity the last time we had something like your talking about was when the league was at its most boring and repetitive pre cba teams need to be broken up teams hoarding talent isnt good for the leagueyou want it cause it gives your blazers a better chance at winning a title itwenty years or whatever thats a fact so u want it purely for your own advantage keeping a team identity is just a convenient excuse to weigh the odds even more into your favori mean even look how u wanna bend the rule for tounami camara u want this purely so it can benefit your small market teamits really not why i want this but you cant seem to grasp that someone could have motivations outside of a want for championships which is surprising given that you are a suns fan a franchise who has yet to win a chip so one would think that you could understand people wanting something else from their team instead of just chips but sadly for you the only chip you have is the one on your shoulder because your big market team couldnt translate its advantages to actually winning it at least once so you whine about small markets as if only they could profit from drafting well but the

for that to become an even bigger obstacle for every team that doesnt have one bunch of nonsense after all that i must have really gotten u in your feelingsyou got supermax contracts and that nd apron you are being greedy wanting this every rule made in the last ten years has been to prop up teams like yoursremember when that microsoft dude owned the blazers esely s u wanna go look how expensive those teams were we got our rich owner we never got our opportunity at that to spend to our hearts content so yeah id be a little salty we get robbed of our opportunity to be the rich team for once and u want double whammy it with this rule fuck that',\n",

       " 'warriors this guy is the dumbest player ever he cant shoot or defend for anything and we literally didnt even trust him in the rotation until our season was basically overalso the warriors your first keon ellis and keegan murray plzexpecting a team to trade this much for the right to sign a guy is delusionalif hes that valuable sign himso they devalue him during his tenure there and kerr publicly came out and said he has no basketball iq yet they want a haul for him okay sureand i would like sydney sweeney to be my gfimagine what they would ask for a player they like and actually playno wonder no kuminga trade has happened yetthey arent getting that lmao why should you get a decent haul for a player that you dont even wantthe warriors have signalled to the whole league they dont want kuminga and they dont think he can play their style of ball they have given up all of their leverage of the situation every team knows they want him moved so theres zero rush to do anything for themjust sign him at the range of m per year and trade this guy by deadline and move ongenuinely think they want him to take the qo at this point loldo they know who theyre tradingthe warriors are so stupid lmaoid consider it highway robbery if they got of those things realistically theyre gonna be lucky to get he just cant play our style of basketball but hed be incredible with your stupid teamwho is paying that lolkuminga welcome back to the golden state warriorsmiles bridges and a second round pick take it or leave itthe warriors have a delusional fo their ability to mismanage assets and badly evaluate talent is uncannyim sure the bulls will be the only team in the league to give the warriors everything theyre asking for they love negotiating against themselvessuch delusionyou want people to pay for fresh sourdough when theyre getting a tube of pillsbury biscuitswarriors destroyed kumingas trade value are asking for the world in a trade back for him and will likely then sign him to the cheapest deal possible to keep himhow about a fax machine for kumingaso do they actually want to keep him then because this is an insane priceif thats what they actually want its too muchbut i suspect this is what theyre saying they want in expectation theyll get less because its a negotiation and you always start highwarriors cant recognize their cognitive dissonance do practically everything last year to say you dont value the guy then act as though hes the best thing since sliced bread for the rest of the league if you valued him like this youd ensure kerr doesnt go to an extreme and fully bench him if you permit kerr to do that then you have to understand youre signaling a devalued asset and youre not getting top value for him cant have it both waysyeah they aint getting none of that he going to walk next year in the warriors aint getting shitwarriors have been weird about kuminga for years none of this makes sensetheyre smoking crack thenthe warriors waited too long to trade wiseman which was a horrible draft pick and now are waiting too long on kumingathey are so beyond delusionalif they think hes worth all of that why dont they just keep him thenall that for a guy they dont want themselves delusionallol they want a st round pick sweets and jonathan kuminga for jonathan kumingathey literally had this dude out of the rotation on an average playoff team with a topheavy rosteri dont know whos more delusional warriors or heathas there been a team who actively hates one of their players more than the warriors and kumingaall parties are delusionalhes staying in the bayi honestly dont get the kuminga hate dude can play his ass off when hes on yes when hes off its pretty rough but i think that can be fixed hes a pretty damn good player hated seeing him come in against the wolves during the playoffshe is a restricted free agent everyone can wait this out kuminga isnt going to win anyone a championship so just wait it out nobody can pay him right now but maybe next season or at least wait this out to the trade deadline when the warriors are screwed by then kuminga doesnt and havent signed any offer from the warriorsthe arrogance is astounding a frp prospect and no bad money for a guy they refuse to play or pay smoking rockalso if he takes the qualifying offer he gets a no trade clausein my bosses eyes i am the bad playercontract he got stuck with i feel like kuminga and the other rfas are going to end up playing one year on the qualifying offer and come back unrestricted free agents when there is more cap space in grimes for kuminga swap makes so much sense for both teams in my opinioni can offer josh green nsj and a second round pickgood luck with thatfor someone they dont even want or value okfor that price the bulls are definitely not getting kumingathis is because of lacob right not dunleavygtf outta heresuns will give you bol bol and a second round pick thats been swapped timeshonest questionwhat happens if there are no takersokc could use a lanky defender and comely young maidens of virtue truelol go away gsw you cant shit on a guy bench him endlessly and then tell the league hes a super valuable assetthe warriors have been completely fumbling on kuminga he was playing the best ball of his career then gets hurt warriors trade for butler and they act like kuminga is garbage the guy doesnt somehow gets completely benched versus a young athletic rockets despite him being the most athletic guy on the team that series ends up being a war and the geriatric warriors win but are banged up injuries force kerr to finally play kuminga in the twolves series and at times kuminga is the best player on the warriors steph of course did get hurt the guy should be considered a year old that has shown flashes of being great and was looking consistently good right before being hurt but the warriors completely tanked his value its insane he didnt play at all in the rockets serieswe want a kuminga level prospect and a first round picklol lmao evenyeah and i want to fuck kim kardashian tonightwatch another team pick up horford and melton because the warriors are sitting too long on kumingaabsolutely delusional i wouldnt even want that guy for free loli wouldnt do that tradeand i want a ponythey know this is a sign and trade right lmaobro is not worth a first rounder lmaoif hes worth that much then pay himwarriors wont play him but want all star player package for him lmaoeven if another team believed in his potential its obvious the warriors dont value him and they have almost no negotiation leveragei cant help but think how much the warriors fumbled kuminga as a player trying to incorporate him in kerrs rotation and as a trade asset for the last several years now it seems were stuckthey have handled this entire situation so poorly for multiple seasons now should have never even reached this pointi bet every single comment here is a variation of theyre delusional theyre negotiatingbetween the fans and the fo i cant think of a player theres more delusion around than kuminga hes never been anything beyond an ok role player and they treat him like hes some future superstar level trade asset not to mention they clearly dont want to sign or start himi mean negotiations gotta start high lmao aint no one sending that sht cant blame dunleavy for shooting high as time goes on it becomes more evident how blessed they and curry were that kd went thereand they provide the slight possibility that you will receive a good player in returnand the kings will still make the trade for lord knows what reasoneasy peasythis makes it seem like they are looking for a kuminga for kuminga lol the reality is its more like a late first th or something and a good young player like ochai agbaji or devin carter thats expensive and they may have to settle but its not ridiculous its basically late firsts kind of valuein exchange you get the honor of paying a guy who only cracked their playoff rotation after steph got hurt seems like a reasonable demand swatch the grizzlies trade santi aldama for him smhand id love to work a job that pays me a gazillion dollars a monthcorrect me if im wrong here if kuminga signs an offer sheet for one season and the warriors match he gets an implied notrade clause just as though he were extended for one year is that one year enough to get him to unrestricted free agency if so he just needs a team to bid high enough to feed the next three generations of his family easy and he ensures gs gets nothing for him when he moves on winwinlolhes a restricted free agent no fucking way why dont they just offer him a contract that you wont match why would anyone give the warriors anything they cant be that stupidlolollolthat last part is hilarious since all theyre giving up is a bad contract by their own admissionwow dunleavy jr thinks kunminga is prime steph or klay he is trying to tradewarriors i want to rob you blind lol dumbass take this tradewarriors need to get ready to speak poverty againno one is stupidly enough to trade that much for kuminga right if they really valued him that way hed be signefoh so they arent trading him thendelusionalstill loli was unaware they had a yankees prospectyea just keep him then is he not the good young player toocome on dude et une pipe au miel en plus so they wanna keep himtell us again about the two time lines dubs havent made a good draft pick since looney in and myers wanted to be treated like a renaissance man for thinking it was good practice to try to develop good players simultaneously and two of them kuminga and poole are leaguewide punch linesthey sound like scalpers lmaonothing youll get nothinglmaooooo good fuckings luck with thatwhy does it have to be a song and trade the warriors arent going to match the contractits wild how many teams shit on their own players and then expect a treasure chest in returnbeyond delusionalgs cracks me up any team can just wait it out but never pay gs or bos or lakers ridiculous asking pricebest i can do is knecth and a second round pick bossteams always try to trade their garbage for value lolwe hate this guy give us all your finest meats and cheeses or you cant have him gsw can fuck offisnt this guy bucky from thunderboltsjust let him go man no ones giving them that or even close holding this guy hostage for whatand i wanna fuck angie dickinson lets see who gets lucky firstokay the guy was getting almost zero playing time until steph got hurtin honestly a bit offended at how the warriors are treating this guyget ready to continue speaking san franciscankillings should have publicly asked for a trade last yearwarriors front office is trashso basically were saying theyd like to just keep him got it okay kings offering top protected st round pick one good looking player saricthis is gonna end up being devin carter and our stupid st thats pick swapped with san antonio if golden state wants more the kings should walk awaylolthey need to just hurry up and trade him for cam thomas and whatever elseapparently golden state has hired danny ainge as their gmwhen you fundamentally misunderstand how trades workif it wasnt for a pretty soft slate of competitors in where they won that title the two timelines might be one of the most disastrous cases of front office mismanagement steph easily should have a few more titles if theyd managed their draft capital even competentlygood luck with that warriors want more value for him than what they even value himlollmao good luckif kuminga is worth all that maybe you should keep himthe warriors have to sign him to a correct value contract have him play regularly and well and trade him at the deadline to hope to get that value that value isnt coming back in a sign and tradei almost wish kuminga takes a qo just so the warriors get fucked out of the assetwhy would anyone trade whne they can just sign him the warriors dont even play himif i am jk agent i would advice him to take the qo innorder to be an ufa next year that would screw the warrriors very bad considering at this point they want to screw themhe would have been signed and traded already if he had that value lmaohey we dont value this guy enough to pay him but we want a haul in return thanks xloljust pay him then if hes worth thatim gonna tell my employer i want more pay less responsibility and no supervisionits comical how emotionally invested other teams fanbases are in this saga when the warriors fo literally doesnt have to do shit they can match any offer that comes in nobody is rushing in to overpay kuminga and the worst that could happen is he takes the qo and has to play out the year to prove hes worth more money in free agencybut please keep on trying to convince yourselves that the warriors fumbled kumingas stardom and he just needs mpg and be the guy on offense or that kuminga is hot dog water and should have been traded two years ago to maximize his value you cant have it both ways though but keep copingkuminga is warriors version of tht except lakers got rid of their extremely overrated low bbiq project but man did we get a lot of tht talk before thatwarriors front office needs to stop this madness and just trade him i cant bear no more kuminga talkpeople need to stop referring to what the warriors think about kuminga as though the organization has one brain the front office is actually high on him its kerr who isnt in trades the front office wants value commiserate with their evaluation of him not their coach but its just isnt going to work that way no one is going to give you equal value to have the right to also pay himtoo much talk for a scrub like kumingathey need bob myers backyou should be worried if they start talking to dumarspretty much lolits like those house hunters episodes where the couple looking for a house work as like a dinosaur trainer and butterfly catcher and their budget millionthere is so much arrogance in how theyve approached this to the degree im beginning to think they lucked into a dynasty like the new england patriots because they drafted one guy that people passed overbradycurryah yes the phillytriestotradebensimmons strategykerr tanked his value smhi willing to give them keegan but i want three firsts after steph retires thats why i kinda hope warriors lose out on this kuminga should sign the qo at the last possible date screw up their plans for horford and other fas fuck themthen no teams will trade for him and hell be right back on the warriorsthe first paragraph has never been the organizations stance on him they are very high on him he just isnt a good fit with their existing core and system and hasnt been able to successfully adapt to the specific role kerr has designated for himthe part everybody seems to be skipping over is that that system and core only have about a year shelf life left and hes better than anything else they have by a wide margin once you remove those factors hes worth significantly more to them in than anything theyre being offered is worth to them in lmao with our front office i wouldnt be fucking surprised one bit of we did thisalso the warriors btw we love you jonathandefinitely would have had a bunch more playing time before the jimmy trade kerr has some weird lineupsits gotta be posturing at this point everybody knows they want to get rid of kuminga a late first and a bench warmer seems about the right price for himkind of a damned if you do damned if you dont situation imo physicallyshot profile wise kuminga is basically younger aaron gordon you can stick him in the dunker spot and let him feast against rotations and have him be a great lob threat shooting might not be there but hes easy offense mentally though kuminga doesnt take accountability on defense unless hes involved in the offense and also wants to be a face up player rather than a dunker spot guygolden state is arguably the worst team in the league for kuminga scheme wise they basically got rid of a legit dunker spot player so they could run stuff where steph and klay get open off ball while dray holds it at the nail golden state also knows this the archetype and player kuminga represents even now is valuable just not to golden state while they have both steph and dray their vision for kuminga was probably more in line with hyper athletic dray rather than an aaron gordon type that isnt happening they need to move on from him since he is an asset to most of the rest of the leaguekuminga also has to accept his role on a team and be willing to sacrifice to play winning basketball but he is still an excellent player for his role also the warriors your first keon ellis kuminga is and they benched him repeatedly ellis is with significantly worse counting stats do the warriors consider him good or youngthis a pretty basic take he doesnt fit with the warriors aging core yes he does fit on a rebuilding team looking for young talent hes and averaged ppg he has valuehe missed three months and came back out of form right before playoffsdude was playing his largest role as the nd scoring option before thatwhy would the warriors give him away for nothing you think they are the mavericks or somethingteams want him the warriors just arent in an immediate rush so theyre starting with an offer they know is too high to force the other party to make a more reasonable offer in their opinion classic pawn stars shiti know youre used to your team doing bad trades but trading a highquality role player for a box of scraps is not how you do a deal also at least we didnt trade out two picks including an unprotected pick next year for a player whos not even proven to be an nbacaliber player seriously pelicans fans should be the last one to call us outim sure they can get a late first but not a first and young player unless its a player a team doesnt want hes just not that desirable get a good player you can play in exchange and end this bullshiti honestly just feel bad for kuminga they are seriously fucking with his nba career and this cant be a good look other agents are seeing how theyve been handling himwith the new cba currently affecting free agency even more the free agent market is basically deada team isnt signing kuminga hes a restricted free agent the warriors can match whatever contract is offered to him outside of the nets no team has enough cap space to make an offer to him the nets dont want him or they would already have a dealunless a team does something similar to what the bucks did in order to sign myles turner kuminga is basically not even a free agent sure technically hes not under contract with the warriors but there is no where he is signing to that the warriors wouldnt just match and keep him and there is no team that will be willing to waive and stretch some large contract in order to sign kuminga for two reasons the first reason is it is a desperate move that has a lot of negative impacts on future roster construction teams like the suns and bucks understand that but they are in a situation of desperation the second reason is he is still a restricted free agent even if a team did clear cap space to sign him out of desperation the warriors could just match the contractthere is no reason for the warriors to trade him for less value than he would have if he was under contract because he is practically still under contract with them its just unknown what is future contract will look likei dont think they expect to trade him at all this offseason they expect to have him back on an extremely teamfriendly deal thats far more tradeable he could take the qo just to say fuck you but thats an enormous risk for a guy that depends so heavily on his athleticism he may never get a contract ever again i predict they split the difference and he signs something like my that gives him m what hed be getting from the qo for the first year plus what he thinks hes worth for a second year m but guaranteed the warriors get a verytradeable m contract and the incoming team gets a guy very probably worth more than m on a teamfriendly dealto be honest i think theyre only playing hardball because they know the kings want him and im not betting against it working out for them because we are fucking stupid and will end up giving assets to sign someone they dont want anywaysthe warriors have the right to sign him though from there its just like any other tradethats just been the warriors post kd us fans are just as delusional as the foalso kuminga only wanting to play for a team where he can start and be a focal point of the offense limits the options even moreits the warriorsthen jk will end up right back with the warriorsyeah they should hold a press conference and announce that they want one second round pick smhexactly youre telling me you want a good young player worth at least the nontaxpayer mle when you have to pay him a first round pick around another m per year and well just say those are good contracts and thats equitable to kuminga then why not just pay kuminga m it costs the same and gives you flexibility of owning his bird rights since you drafted himso disingenuous and unserioussounds like a player that is worth at least mil a year just based on that asking pricethey are just forcing him to take the qo since they know nobody has the space outright to sign himit seems like the warriors arent wanting to pay a premium for him which is understandable it is questionable where he fits in the rotation and how good of a player he actually ison the other side kuminga seems like he doesnt like playing for steve kerr kerr is strongly against players like kuminga he has the talent but kuminga was a high lottery pick he wants to be given a chance to show what hes capable of on a team that will allow him to score and be the player he isin order for kuminga to succeed on the warriors he would need to be a capable perimeter defender that can cut to the basket defend at a high level shoot open threes and most importantly make the extra passsteve has been very insistent on going with the system of get steph the ball steph is obviously a good player and has the most impact as an off ball player who is constantly running around and can shoot from anywhere so it is important for guys like kuminga to be able to find him he isnt the best at that kuminga is really talented he has shown to be able to get to the rim easily shoot threes at an improving rate is a capable defender while still showing room for improvement but the finding steph is the biggest concern kuminga is an iso player that isnt talented enough yet to contribute to winning as an iso player perhaps if given the opportunity he could quickly be successful but thats not something kerr or the warriors want to test as the warriors want to capitalize on currys final seasonstheyve offered him a contract and they offered him a better contract last year he doesnt want to sign and other teams arent willing to give him morewe have tried he wants more money at mil great at nothe warriors have all leverage since no team is going to pay him since they dont have cap space he should have take that contract offer they gave him last year at this point he would have been in another team already his best bet now is to take the qo and demand a trade once he can be tradedthey willthe whole point of a trade is that your assets and the other teams assets are worth the same but they dont necessarily fit your teamedit im being downvoted for this so what is the point of a tradenot to mention they dont even want to pay him nowif they were offering him the max or close to it and he just preferred another city i could understand them wanting a haul as the alternativebut they are literally trying to low ball him they didnt value him during the season they dont value him for the future but if he wants to leave they basically want a near equal package to what the suns got for duranti mean maybe it will work but this seems like an utterly insane drunk person trying to negotiatesydney sweeney and a side chickshoot for the stars and you could land on the moon loli see someone understands how a negotiation workssubtext of this is they actually dont want to trade him they just dont want to pay him jalen green money they do need his scoring for the regular season and resigning him would make them a better team theres still a scoring issue on the roster that they arent going to fill without him and butlercurrydraymond should probably be game players at mosti would bet he starts at least games if plays for the warriors next season if he can stay healthythe kerr hates kuminga thing is way overblown kuminga was playing well then had a really bad ankle injury and missed basically half the season he came back to a team that was completely different and playing at a win pace a week before must win play in games as a ball dominant player pretty hard to make major team structure adjustments like that with kuminga in contract showcase modei meanwe dont want to trade him lol this is saying we move only for the fuck you pricethe whole point is we want to retain kuminga more years to pair with this curry and butler team off the bench after that hes either gone or we are giving him the keys no one can sign him no one can trade for him hell accept some middling or year offer and hell have to play hard anyway even if he is unsatisfied because thats the only way he gets a big extensionthe warriors have all the leverage in the world here kuminga has little value on the market and nobody except the nets have cap space to offer him a contract the warriors wouldnt match hes most likely going to be forced to sign a team friendly deal with the warriors due to market conditions and then hell either be a part of the teams plans or be traded off at the deadline for a better haul because hes a valuable asset when hes on a team friendly deal right now the warriors are just saying kuminga the asset is worth keeping and signing to a cheap deal unless someone makes us an offer we cant refuse and it seems that nobody else is foolish enough to make that offer which is reasonablehow do you convince teams that you dont want to trade your player in a tradethats probably the plan currently kuminga and his agent are probably asking for more and both sides are playing chickenhe wants more than that and even if they did sign him for m years then the warriors risk being stuck with an unhappy kuminga long termmaybe kuminga takes the qo if you offer that and then gsw just loses him for nothingno one wants to take on that contract or theyd make an offer sheet for the warriors to matchi agree thats one more cheap year to support steph they have no interest in keeping him and know no other team can sign him without a st so just force him into the qo with an absurd st asking pricekumingas camp has to be furiouskuminga and his agent probably know he is screwed for the off season if he takes the qo because what team is gonna have the cap space to do milyear for kuminga more importantly what team wants to use the cap space on him also imagine gsw would tank the hell out of his value even further if he did thatboth sides need the resigning because gsw is equally screwed if he doesnt if im kuminga i do mil years and guaranteed playing time during the season until they trade himmil years is the sweet spot for gsw but obviously he doesnt want thatthats exactly what they want they clearly dont value him long term but he can theoretically help them win games in the regular season and having a guy like that on a cheap short term deal in one of currys last seasons would be a win for themthen why put anything outwarriors about to become the post jordan bulls the moment curry call it quitslight years ahead lol timelines years apartnot really they are playing their hand no team can get jk without their help last year luka was traded for street clothes you shouldnt be surprised if a team ends up over paying for himno no no they have two time lines rememberhave lapped the lakers the past decadewarriors bad updoots to the left plsyet they have still won titles in the last years and gotten very close to multiple other titles i think theyre doing just finefair deali was thinking his value might be the same as the printer from office spacethey want the best offer on the table to be their milyear so that hes a super tradeable contract at the deadline bc then they can probably send him out and picksplayers for an upgrade my understanding is that trading him now with a st means that salary coming in will be less than going out which isnt idealthis is laughably high though i get setting the bar high but this makes me walk away because i dont want to deal with this bullshit from them like saying no bad contract and a st okay or young player and no bad contract but screaming you need all and this isnt the first report after we all see how little you actually value the player is just insulting tbhi think us the fans feel insulted by this statement it questions our intelligence and observations i can only imagine being in an nba fo i wouldnt be able to stop laughing at themsome players just dont mesh well in a steph curry centered offense its a good thing the other teams dont run this offense so jk still has valueeh why does gs have to rush to trade kaminga there are some very very dumb gms out there just ride it out for a bit until the brain worms activateits a pushtbh not many are hating on kuminga in the comments its perplexing to see the fos demands for a player they are not keen on playing and keep benching of course he has value but you cant dip his value on the court and then demand these prices the irony is that if he picks up the qualifying offer hell have an ntc so he can walk away as an ufa next year if they refuse to play him this year which would mean that they would lose him for fuckall its a giant game of who blinks firsthe returns on the qualifying offer and is an unrestricted free agent next summer or he holds out all season i think march st is the last day to accept the qo and becomes a restricted free agent next summer again when more teams have cap spaceof course not playing for a full season probably diminishes his value on the marketchurchgnarly brothershit i hope so that hawks jersey doesnt have anyone wearing it right nowi would pay to see that happenyou wishing and hoping huhyour team would gladly take kuminga for freetrying to but he wants more than what is reasonable same problem with every rfawhen kerr benched him in the playoffs he should have been traded but my org likes to waitbrother the asking price hasnt changed in nearly monthsthis jk rfa thing coulda been handled weeks ago not like the warriors have done anything elseassuming hes being offered around million over like years if he sucks this year on the qo then he may lose out on s of millions of dollars its a risky betlmaowould rather just saric and the pick if we have to settle for a bad deal carter would just get buried on our guard heavy roster release saric immediately and pretend we got value by getting a fake firstthats most likely always been the plan just have to wait for jk to take the lowball offer or qo with that is kerr can be an asshole and make up reasons to dnp him hurting his value further but that may be where this is heading either way fo botched this by drafting guys their coach clearly never cared aboutplease dont make fun of my nephew carteras much as i love bob myers him whiffing on two of those picks is the reason were here in the first placekuminga for herb jones it is thendumars could recreate a modern version of that historic andre drummond greg monroe josh smith front line with derik queen kuminga zionyou mean dumarsei amnot even dumars would be that stupidthis is genuinely a good point though just take a swing and try and ask for crazy things and it might work then youll probably get morethere was a time in like where dumars was widely regarded as one of the best nba executives of the decade teenage me would never believe how far hes fallenthey did get lucky not only did steph curry fall to they tried to trade him at least different times that we know of after drafting himthey took advantage of it correctly but how they got durant added was flukey as wellthey did luck into a dynasty the twolves had picks before them and took point guards rubio and flynntrue but cant you say that almost every dynasty is lucked intowell theres always luck involved but remember the team is being run by a different gm nowthey also drafted quite possibly the nd greatest shooter ever and one of the best defenders in league historywasnt all luck they had jerry westnot completing the draft day trade that had been negotiated in advance with the suns the curry pick for amare stoudemire was a stroke of genius who was the suns gm steve kerr btw steve kerr traded shawn marion too what is this nonsense take we also drafted two other hall of famers in klay and draymondits underrated how bad of a gm bob was go and look at how some of those championship rosters were filled out and the arrogance of two timelines is staggering you have an arguable top ten player of all time why arent you tying to maximize his yearsneither of these teams lucked into a dynasty but especially not the patriotsthis is a terrible example in tom bradys year tenure as a starter in new england the patriots had a top scoring defense times and a top defense times they were a dynasty because when brady the undisputed goat had a bad day that defense could hold down the fort enough for him to put together a good drive or two and win like they did in their last sb win when they won vs the rams or their first when they won vs the greatest show on turf saying that the pats lucked into a dynasty is a nephew take even for this subi think it is the other way curry lucked out by warriors change of ownership around without an ownership who was ready to spend to win wed have seen curry languishing in his prime yearshow on earth is this arrogance what else should they do what do you think this arrogance will cost them explain this to me this just seems like the warriors refusing to overpay for a mediocre player but also wanting that player for cheap yourself and not wanting to give the player away for cheap so yeah explain how this is arrogance and not excellent front office decision makingits all david kahns faultof course they did i mean most teams do unless youre the lakers and can be run horribly but gifted all time players due to locationso many things had to happen for the warriors dynasty to happen people played up myers so much but in reality dude tried to trade steph during the ankle issues and was saved by the bucks medical team saying notried to trade klay but was saved by west threatening to resignsigned steph to like of the max who then took maybe the biggest single season leap of all time from injury prone allstar to bb mvp competing with lebron for best player in the league this allowed them to stack depthany none lakers dynasty takes a lot of luck spurs were lucky as hell to have robinson get hurt then get the pick in a draft who happened to be a top all time playerone thing ill give them credit for is hiring kerr that move took a lot of balls to hire a rookie head coach while feeling immense pressure with such a talented roster i know he gets a lot of hate here but he completely revolutionized the team and was a big part of unleashing the curry we know today plus was a defense first coachyep their front office absolutely sucks hey we want a frp and a good young player for a guy we dont even want to pay straight dumbassesarent dynasties usually based on luck spurs drafting admiral and duncan kobe and shaq forcing his way to lakers gsw hitting in the draft multiple years in a row for their core etcjerry west pretty much they were gonna trade klay for kevin love ffs he had to riot to make them stopthey got a dynasty due to kd and currys injuriesthey got to an elite competing team s to s houston rockets because of curry strong depthcomplimentary draftingwithout kd its rings and likely only finals appearances in maybe and that would be a very elite team but short of being a dynasty rings from to years got them to be a dynasty but that was due to kd coming whicb was doable due to curries injuries early on and cap exploding in the summer as opposed to say they did get lucky with him and this arrogance is warranted from them but its still trash and they can fuck off with that attitude golden state knows the moment steph leaves theyre heading back to the bottomtriggeredand we will all be devastated about itthats the point imo no point trading him for devin carter if you can preserve the salary for a move down the line unless you get what you want right nowwhich is fineon a qualifying offer that has a no trade clausewarriors good point we need an additional firstso much value where kerr benches him regularlyand he if has the value you say he has sign himthere is a lot of breathing room between nothing and what the warriors are currently asking forand that is how you end up with kuminga on a year mil per aav contract still benching him and lowering his value even moreyoud think theyd be in more of a rush since this situation is holding up their offseason movesfa started weeks ago theyve just been sitting on their hands the entire timeteams wanted him at the trade deadline when he was playing well not now when he was benched for the second half of the seasonthe best i can do is royce oneale and protected second roundersso triggered for whatthis is an embarrassing comment lolpatrick williams and the blazers pickim not sure why you are surei mean whatever team is taking him is basically taking a flier on him ffs and an expensive flier at that no way anyones gutting a portion of their roster for the absolute privilege of bringing in jonathan kaminga at to million dollarsso basically they just keeping him they can sign him to that or let him walk next season and he can sign a mid level exception somewhere in free agency and no one is going to lose any sleep of over the missed opportunity that was jonathan kuminga i get the warriors want to get something for him since they fucking blew their lottery picks for the two timelines but its clear a split is coming its either right now or after this season kuminga would be a fool to sign any contract for more than a year unless the price jumps theres more cap space next year and future years this is a rare scenario where qo could make sense even if he gets buried which it sounds like he already was lolwarriors fans will continue to gaslight us and say its always the other people who are the problempoole now kuminga when evidence clearly points to the organization being utterly shit when it comes to developing players that they drafted other than the big three and looneyive always wondered how much an organization playing hard ball really matters in the long run players want the max money they can get when its their turn to signi agree its not great for his career but also wasnt he offered a contract last year i briefly googled and all the articles are too recent but thought he had a decent offer turning down the contract last year lead to this whole issue wasnt it like m a year that was dumb if his management encouraged him to bet on himself with this cba he should fire them if he wanted to bet on himself then thats on himin years kuminga hasnt developed any basketball iq even playing with guys like steph and draymondthats why he should take his qo that would be a big fu to the front office of the teamits kumingas agent thats a moronhe can sign the qualifying offer and walk for free next summeri think they screwed up wisemans career as wellhe still gonna get paid a bunch and probably get to a team that wants him by this trade deadline and rfa can get like thiscan hardly say you should feel bad for kuminga when a lot of the basics of just being able to step on the court for the warriors is something as simple as rebounding thats how podz continues to start over him despite being significantly less talentedhow have they been handling him they dont feel hes a winning player so they didnt play him now hes a restricted free agent and anyone can sign himhe had on the table last year and said nahhow have they been handling him they dont feel hes a winning player so they didnt play him now hes a restricted free agent and anyone can sign himlets be honest kuminga and his entourage are the ones fucking up his careerthey basically did that during the season when they benched him for games its really clear the warriors dont actually value himreports are that he doesnt want to stay in golden statethey are offering him mwarriors have offered him m he was offered million last offseason he declined then and is not accepting the current offer now this is fully in kumingas court its not like the warriors are offering him a minimum lmaoright but gsw can end up paying him a lot less since the market is dogshit for restricted free agents so if the warriors think they can play hardball and then get kuminga at myear or something thats a pretty good deal sort of the same reason mikal bridges was getting traded for st rounders the player value skyrockets if hes not counting much against your cap and i assume thats the perspective the warriors havethe qo gives kuminga a no trade clause the warriors dont want that because he can block any trade and leave next offseason for nothingno neither kuminga nor the warriors want the qo to be the final outcomehes gone on principle if they take this routewhat exactly are his talents kuminga cannot pass cannot hit fts horrible handle cannot shoot for shit mediocre on defense zero bbiq wont rebound wont hustle back his only talents are play finishingkuminga isnt worth a first and a good young player in a regular trade and typically teams receive a lot less from a sign and tradesign and trade aint about matching value is about giving something for a piece you dont want anymore or in this case at some price kd went to nets for dlo for example if you want to trade kuminga for that value sign him and then move him after monthskds st didnt even fetch that amountitll probably work as the league will make it happen for curryand no baggagelineup flexibility is keyprotectedtheres a difference between starting high and starting highthats how you get people to laugh at you before they walk awaydeletedoh is that why the coach has badmouthed him in the mediayeah you guys should keep him let that locker room take some hit while paying him to just pout and be a negative asset should sign like too i mean at least its not a year lolim not talking about the leverage they have over their own rfa of course they have it all they have no leverage in any deals with other teams is what im saying and thats clearly the case thats why like you said they want to sign him to a movable dealyou know if he rakes the qualifying offer he gets a no trade clauseyou play him during the seasonthats not so simple but what i do know is benching the guy and then refusing to pay him is not how you do itprobably by not benching them in the playoffs until you have no other choicetheres a difference in trying to convince teams hes good and asking for to much the warriors view themselves as contenders and he hasnt been able to crack their rotation consistently which signals to other teams this isnt a guy whos ready to contribute to winning its not like he is in year one or two its soon to fifth year in the league if after four full seasons he isnt ready to help a contender then hes upside really isnt that high yet the return they are asking for is that of a blue chip prospect in year onetwoquack quacknobody has the salary to make that offer sheetthats not necessarily true it could be that all teams want to take on kuminga for m but dont want to send back what the warriors want in returni believe hes with verus managment group they dont have much of a nba client list so i think the warriors arent too worried about pissing them offidk maybe there is a number that other teams have agreed upon that they need to convince jk to takecouldnt happen to a nicer fanbaseedit who am i kidding theyll all just go back to being lakers fans againthats fine alone will feed me for the rest of my life that and i can afford tickets again loland they lapped golden state for the previous five its all about the present dudei think theyre talking about the present not the pasti mean youre right in saying in the last but why say when their first one of the four was yeah keep living in pal maybe the cap will jump another m so you can sign giannis in accept that theyre a poverty franchise who got lucky and will go back to the gutter when steph is gone basically bulls post jordanjust read his username lolmaybe if he wasnt an abuser who should be out of the leaguefor real nets wanted frps for cam johnson they settled on frp but so far out that itll probably be a very valuable frp kings offered carter saric second rounders now its a protected frp and warriors are like well take an unprotected frp keon ellis one of the leagues best point shooters and literally a guy putting up all defensive team defensive metricslike worlds apart and the warriors dont have the leverage they hurt kumingas player value as an asset and they shot themselves in the foot at the negotiating table showing how badly they dont want him and he doesnt want them its silly kuminga should stick it to them and take that qo and pick his future next season i think he does warriors dont wanna pay him more than to ride their benchthankswould be the most exciting thing to happen for kings in yearswe have wings not including sharpe significantly better than him assuming grant returns close to his normal form and we still want to develop murray and rupertkuminga is wildly overrated kerr literally played fuckin gui santos over him lmaokuminga is literally aytondunleavy being hard headed lol i cant defend itcheers its an antivanvleet situation instead of betting on himself taking a multiyear offer is betting that he sucks or financially insuring himself against the possibilityif he takes the qo they are gonna weld him to the benchevery coach has his players and types of players clearly he did tried with kuminga he even started some games and got pissed that it doesnt really fit his system so he end up benching himhe wouldve moved off those picks before their value was as low as it isdont forget pick swapskuminga for zionman that would be a fantastic fit in gs loli play in a k online league and did exactly that trade month ago very happy oh god although for a straight swap is that terriblea young player named herb in the big will never not be baffling to mekuminga isnt fat enoughbregman roe the goati think it all went downhill when he traded away billups for iverson not saying that it was the main cause but there wasnt a lot of bright spots in terms of his moves since then i even thought the ben gordon signing was great it just didnt workand they got currys rookie extension on the cheap because of his ankles and injury concerns if curry signed for the max at that time they dont have the money to pay for everyone else he was making million a year through on top of that in of the other timelines currys ankles remain paper mache and we think of him like brandon roylight years aheadthey took the risk on an undersized guard thats wasnt just luck they took the risk of building around himimo what really lucked them into a dynasty is locking down curry in what turned out to be the best valued contract ever in nba history and the nbpa deciding to not spread the cap out throughout multiple years putting all of that cap growth to one season which in turn gave gs the ability to sign kd to a max contractthey were always gonna be title contenders and i dont take away that first chip injuries happen they lost one due to injuries as well but the circumstances of getting kd was pure lucknot to mention curry being the th or so highest paid player in the league as a back to back mvp that was so crucial to extend their championship windowthe david kahn piecekahnnnnnyes you absolutely cansan antonio is objectively wellrun got hofers with nonlottery picks but they arent the franchise you aspire to be if they dont luck into picks in the robinson duncan or wemby draftstry building a dynasty around keith van horn or antonio daniels have fun with thati think its fair to say about most championships but not dynastiespeople been itching on the downfall for a while this sub hasnt exactly been quiet about thatyou think the pats didnt luck into picking tom brady in the th round and keeping him as the th qb on the rosteryou think they didnt luck into belichick after the stupid browns fired himyou think that the pats would have a great defense under any coach besides belichick or good draftingyou think the pats wouldve even played brady if drew bledsoe didnt get hurtyou think the pats didnt get lucky when tom brady took a pay cut to build a better roster around himand yes the warriors did get lucky in their dynasty too we got lucky the wolves didnt draft him instead of rubio and flynn we got lucky with drafting klay and dray too we also got lucky that steve kerr chose gsw over the knicks as head coach we also got lucky that steph hurt his ankle and took a massive pay cut in which allowed us to build a better roster around himso yeah ill be the guy will the nephew take here both the pats and ws lucked into their dynastiesgood scoring defense is also a result of long methodical mistakefree drives by the offense it also helps when you have the goat qb under market value who is able to create an elite passing game throwing to undrafted and undersized receivers allowing you to put most of your resources cap space high draft picks into the defensive side of the balltriggered nah i just hope warriors scree themselves over on thissome of the warriors haters clearly will beexactlyat this point its preferredonly if he wants to be the next nerles noel bag fumbler ill get back to you when it settled i know you kings fans want the warriors to get fucked over at every turn but your thirst will not dictate realitythey just might sign himyeah if i get a not worthless st thats a win if i get a young player that i like thats a win no bad contracts back a win these mfrs want the whole grand slamkuminga on a m aav contract is still a good deal hes not some bad playerwarriors would sign that contract today if jk only asked for years mand yet somehow they still get in the top of offseason ratings damnyouwarriorsclassic contract negotiation tank job tbh why should we allow you to hold out to get a bigger payout when we can just bench you dont showcase you and drop your stock the lakersdfs tank job was hilarious and ended up not working as he got paid after all too bad its not as easy with jk as dubs can just matchmost sensitive fans in sportsim actually alright with that and im not even a kuminga fankuminga wants m a year which is laughable im not sure id want my team to even throw at him hes a very solid player but he hasnt proven much to be making these demandsthe two timelines thing doesnt even make any sense when kuminga is getting dnps lol somehow this guy is good enough to command a first and a good player just for the opportunity to sign him to a big contract but not good enough to crack the rotation of a team that is giving trace jacksondavis mpgi really wanted franz wagner to fall to the kings so i was super happy the warriors took kuminga they were super dumb to take kuminga over wagner wagner is the kind of high bbiq versatile defender who sets screens and makes the extra pass who is perfect for their system the warriors didnt deserve two time lines because they made dumb pickshis value is fucked either way he will just get dnpd again next year decreasing his value even more before fa hitstaking the qo is incredibly dangerous even ignoring the risk of injurythe warriors wont have any incentive to develop him further instead of the minutes a game hes been getting he might just get benched entirely with the warriors trying to win nowthat would likely result in him being a mle tier player in free agencya big thing people often ignore is that some very notable people who had a big influence in setting up what would become the warriors dynasty is not in the org any moreandor the warriors are a classic mushroom organization in companies this is when you have established management not going anywhere and junior and mid level staff has to get out to get opportunities the warriors were blessed to have starting positions in the durant years utterly locked in with superstars the curse was almost no opportunity for role players to get the reps and trust they needed to eventually take over even if the picks and players were right everyone was going to be on a short leash while supporting the coredont say this in the warriors sub they will crucify youtruth of the matter is we have developed basically nobody in a decadeim gonna keep saying it this team is built on a single loadbearing curry steve kerr has not developed a wellrounded roster he has a model that he has overfitted to steph currys performance when steph was young and in his prime that was fine because steph curry is that playernow look man curry is still going to be curry but there will be more bad nights than there were before more injuries than there were before we saw it during the series with the wolves with curry off the team that entire system just fell the fuck apart they were out there without a true point guard trying to make something happen and it didntlo and behold during that same series kuminga was the only one getting out on the floor and constantly putting out energy and getting hoops like man kerr the kid can play maybe its kinda on you for not finding a way to play him maybe youve in conjunction with the fo fucked the team up by monofocusing so much on currylmao name one player who warriors threw out and has gone on to thrive in their career poole the guy who was dumped to the worst team in the league and was coming off the bench if poole was so talented why are the wizards trading him away no player who has failed under kerr has gone on to thrive in a different settingyou dont spend time developing players when you still have a top player in curry the owners fo and kerr feel they owe it to him to try their best to win now in the bloodbath in the west you cant afford to lose games to give your young guys time to learnthe real problem was the two timeline approach that completely whiffed draft picks are notoriously high variance so i dont really blame them too much there but they clearly shouldve packaged those picks to fill out the roster with good role playing vets insteadi dont think kuminga was offered milseason he wouldve taken thatyou develop bbiq by playing gameswiseman screwed up his own career by being unable to do something as simple as set a screen with his massive frame lolnah wiseman simply doesnt understand basketball on an nba levelpoor guy cant catch a break knee injury and then achilleslmao what the fuck have you seen his abysmal college career trash games warriors screwed that too if they dont think hes a winning player they shouldnt be demanding so much for him most teams dont have cap space to give him a marketlevel offer sheetthis is the kind of shit that makes me roll my eyes so many people talk right out of their asses like they know when its clear they dont know shitdo you think kuminga was benched for games last season they benched him for gamesare you counting the months he was injuredhuh til qualifying offers get automatic ntcsso maybe they would rather have kuminga cheap for a year than take back these veteran role player contracts for multiple years being offered in stswhich maybe the warriors value clean books over the veteran role players being offered in sts on their books for multiple yearsso are you saying the asking price we see in the title is excessive and warriors are being unreasonablethats not whats being discussed though kd went to nets for dlo for examplekd was going to sign as a free agent but then realized he could make more money in a st so they changed it but no other teams were involved so it was technically a st but really just a free agent signing this is not that kuminga is not a free agentkd is kuminga is no prosthetics now collagen either or no deallolso you think thats analogous to having sydney sweeney be your girlfriendhe hasnt been around our facility much the last couple summers but hes got a couple young girls hes much more settled down now wants to be in one place so hes going to be in our gym and were going to hammer home those those points with him and and uh try to you know try to get them to understand all those loose balls all those long rebounds like you know with his athleticism uh those are plays you know for for him to help us win you know hes got to get those reboundshes got to chase down those loose balls hes got to run the floor sprint the floor and if he does all these things then then theres no question he can find a better role and find a better fit next to jimmy and steph and draymond so thats the goal as a coaching staff to try to help him achieve that and add those things to his game to give himself more of a chance to playwillard thats an interesting conversation it sounds like you guys have because steve if we had a nickel for every time a listener called us and said boy jk must want out of here does jk you think does he want to stay a warriorkerr i think the number one thing is that jk and i have a very good relationship we talk all the time we like each other this is all just basketball this is not a case of jk coming in saying hey i got to get out of here i want this i want that this is just trying to make this fit and trying to make this workkerrs post season interview on kuminga btw people are blowing this out of proportion i think dunleavy especially wants to keep kuminga and met with him to discuss his role with the future of the warriors franchise early this offseason iirc obviously kuminga wants a bigger role but i think he has said he wants out before as a way to pressure for playing time here he is using it as a way to try and pressure gsw into committing to him more fullykuminga has requested trades before our locker room vibes were pretty great on our stretch with jimmy and steph regardless and kuminga even got some chances to shine coming off injury which i think made kerr very reluctant to play him big minutes he didnt look amazing in the playoffs i think we run it back i think kuminga is going to get a m deal or something along those lines where it expires right as steph and jimmy do where we will have massive cap space to give him a great deal if he has earned itmy point is that those two things are linked warriors have a ton of leverage to force him into signing a movable deal because he doesnt have other options then he gets traded at the deadline for something because he actually has value at that point it doesnt really matter for the warriors if that trade happens now or at the deadline but they would be extremely stupid to trade him now for a bad or negative return when they can basically force him to be movable and get a better return in a few monthshis only alternative is to take the qo at extreme risk to his future earnings at which point he becomes untradeable but is so cheap that hes a decent supporting piece for one of currys last seasonsin any trade or sale of a used product its pretty clear that the other party intends to sellwhile true hes still very attractive to teams not trying to win now the suns just traded kd for jalen green who is in a similar positionthats the pointthat makes sensegenerous to think theyll continue watching basketballi swear over of the bay was rooting for the lakers during the kobe years i know lots of hispanic dudes still do in even though they are from the bayor clippers if they do better lakers fans wont accept them thats for sure especially since their clown ass fanbase were shitting on us the past yearswarriors fans were just lebron hates they do not want to be part of the lakers family lolcould be ustephcurryloverl and the point still stands you know he isnt worth anything but want to make it impossible for him to leave and force him to play on a year qo lmaodespite limited rotation time early in the playoffs in the conference semifinals kuminga delivered highefficiency scoring a ts on ppg in roughly minutes per game but im sure gui santos is better correct would be embarrassing as fan but i could totally see kerr doing thatmy thing is this was clear before the draft and during his rookie season he wasnt a kerr guy but this organization continues to ignore their coach and sit on assets till they have no valueno he wouldnt he didnt move wiseman until he was worth basically gplook i love myers but he was the problem near the end of his tenure not the solution he flat couldnt draft but he could attract free agentsexcept they said no bad contractswarriors fans would uncritically think that this is a fleece for the pelicans dubs fans a month ago were basically proposing trades which were variants of your best young star picks for our trashwould be horrible spacing with jimmy zion and draymond jimmy is more of a nowkuminga on a million dollar contract in new orleans will gain half a zionfrom my understanding he was paid fair market at the time for players among his caliber it wasnt until the ink dried that the market price went up and the contract stayed the sameis that luck they paid a guy market value and he took a leap why do teams not get credit for developing guysthis is scary to realize i wonder who would be the greatest shooter ever if we lived in those other timelinesand harden might have a ringit was lucky no one said its just lucki mostly agree but think its weird that even if they dont get kd they automatically dont win rings those years pretty sure they were the betting favorites in before they signed kd people do this weird thing where they think its the warriors minus kd against the cavs which still get to use that giant cap bump if they dont get kd they still use up that cap for good playersi still think they win maybe without kd although obviously biased opinion i think its fairyup that legendarily team friendly curry contract is what led to them being able to sing iggy as a fanot as crucial as you think they had both klay and green in rookie extensions and i believe steph was also on his rookie extension steph signed his max the year after durant signedalso trail blazers being dumb and not listening to bob knight and just drafting mj and making him play center san antonio is objectively wellrun got hofers with nonlottery picks but they arent the franchise you aspire to be if they dont luck into picks in the robinson duncan or wemby draftssame with the celtics if the nets dont make the worse trade in historykeith van horn catching strays in the only thing from the above the pats lucked into was picking brady after he slid so far but you cant luck into a dynasty and winning superbowls which is what the person i responded to saidevery other point above is related to hiring bellichick which absolutely wasnt luck you have your history completely wronghe wasnt fired from the browns then hired by the pats he spent time as dc under parcels and then returned to new england where he was previously a dc and assistant hc under parcels before he had a great relationship with ownership and loved the organization in just his one year he spent there as dc and assistant hc we got lucky the wolves didnt draft him instead of rubio and flynnthis wasnt some obvious choice that the wolves fucked upevery pundit had rubio going over curry the wolves didnt even have curry work out flynn was more unexpected but not some crazy move we got lucky with drafting klay and dray tooor maybe thats just great scouting how is every good pick supposedly luck in your eyes we also got lucky that steve kerr chose gsw over the knicks as head coachgo back and look at the knicks roster he wouldve inherited and tell me seriously this was a tough choice for him we also got lucky that steph hurt his ankle and took a massive pay cut in which allowed us to build a better roster around himsteph was not going to get a huge contract averaging under ppg in his third year battling for a starting spot the bigger decision was curry over monta ellis but i guess youll just say thats luck too lmaoi dont think you understand how luck works nephew good scoring defense is also a result of long methodical mistakefree drives by the offenseduring their superbowl winning seasons the pats ranked th nd th th th and th in top in those same seasons they ranked th st nd th st and th in scoring defense in all of the seasons they ranked in the top they were a run first team that relied on grinding down defenses and letting their defense shut down opposing offenses during bradys prime from their offense was explosive and quick making it harder for their defense to rest and recover before getting back on the field throwing to undrafted and undersized receiverskinda disrespectful to deion branch and edelman also did gronk just not exist also had randy moss for a few years but wasnt able to win a chip allowing you to put most of your resources cap space high draft picks into the defensive side of the ballthis was a huge factor in their success and no one ever said it wasnthow are the warriors getting fucked over when they dont even want himwell he is under contract and they spent a high pick for him they dont want to just get back second round picks a potential bust and a player they wouldnt play like the kings are offering the warriors are close to aprons so they are being methodical before bringing in contractsi think its their best interest to keep him and i am a kuminga fan he was looking like a key player until the warriors got jimmy the warriors situation is tough because of the new cba that owners voted on to make it tough for teams like the warriors why would they want to help out other teams by giving him away cheapfor someone they think is unplayable for them and not worth more than mil too what a jokepretty much hes like one of the few players who arent useless when their three point shot isnt falling but warriors gotta warrior who is rating their offseason well i feel like the entire discourse around it has been what the hell is going on with kuminga along with horford will probably sign herelakers tried to tank dfs value he was a really important piece for us and we treated him as such how did we try to tank how valueyou hate our team unnecessarily and enter our sub just to leave hate comments i dont think you should be the one defining what a sensitive fan meansfr its a youth guy with potential and a st round pick that will definitely convey and has no protections whatsoever agreed i actually might consider mil which to be clear would be the absolute upper limit and take a shot on him improving some things especially on a suns team thats not going anywhere this season anyway but no more than that and certainly not giving away a bunch of other things of known value to bring him inand we cant really compete with sacremento anyway especially if they are that willing so they can have him yeah they basically blew every single pick im not really swayed by moody at all for where he was drafted hes definitely a letdown they had an insane opportunity with all those picksthis is super revisionist most people had kuminga going at around or even higher and franz was seen as a reachobviously they would be much better with him in hindsightyeah but his best avenue for long term money and for his career is the fastest way off the team so if that means taking m this year to get dnpd all year then taking a small prove it deal next year with a team that wants him he will get a chance to earn what he thinks hes worthhed be wasting a roster spot if they decided to do that or not trade him he could also just get bought out and go elsewhere to improve his value the reality is he will probably have to settle for m this year and a prove it year deal if the warriors do decide to bury him but lets be honest hes getting buried either way they dont like playing him for his career the sooner he gets out of there the sooner he can continue with his career and earnings of course if they actually offer him a solid contract with the plans to trade him then he should consider it but i have no reason to believe thats happened i bet they havent offered anything over m and my guess is it was probably a deal worth years minimumjerry west isnt there to build the team for them anymorefr mark jackson aint walking through that tunnelyeah this is an argument i made al ot last year for the hawks season to fans that really wanted us to bring in vets playing time opportunity cost is a very real thing for young players development and theres only minutes a game for a person rostertheyve also chosen to give minutes to twoway and vet minimum guys like ty jerome anthony lamb and saric instead of giving their young high draft picks a bit of a leash off the bench but yeah as far as starts go throw in wiggins and its been hard if not impossible for a young player to crack the lineupto be fair you havent really had the picks to draft any young players to develop in the past decade the one time you did was a covid bust wiseman poole was going well until the incident other than that its not like yall had many opportunitiesif you think kuminga can play so much why doesnt any gm think he has value you saying teams are dumb and you know betterlol thats still on kerr andor the front office your org either cant draft well or cant develop welllast year there was discussion of a milseason offer kuminga wanted a max lmao kuminga was willing to settle for m and warriors rightfully walked awayit was legit reported he turned down million over years lmao insane bag fumble thank god he did my point is by going to a win now gs team he never got a chance to develop in the nba and kerry never wanted a young player on that roster i mean its not out of the realm of possibility you see what they are doing to kumingahe needed to actually play in collegei dont think he ever had a chance to do that and it ruined his confidence and obviously the injuries played a part as welllmao calm down buddy yes i watched his college games he avg points and rebounds in those games i dont see how thats trash great youre a warriors fan who hates wiseman i get it but i saw that steve kerr never wanted to take a draft pick in that draft and wanted to trade it for a veteran and felt that the organization forced wiseman on him it is what it is as i said he probably didnt work as hard as he should have he probably didnt pick up on the pro game as quickly as he should have and he was injured but yeah the warriors screwed him as well kinda like they have screwed kumingaif teams dont meet the trade offer they wont then they can sign him for cheap which i assume is what their goal istheyre demanding that he plays team basketball on both sides of the ball thats iti believe its not an explicit no trade clause in the deal but just the way bird rights transfer allows the player on the qo to be able to influence where he gets traded warriors would still have his bird rights if he signs the qo which transfer if he gets traded except the qo is only a one year deal so for the new team to keep the benefit bird rights they have to be certain he will sign an extension with them if he indicates he doesnt want to sign an extension with the new team then hes less valuable as an asset and team likely passes on the trade so this gets referred to as a notrade clause but isnt an explicit part of the contract like beal hadjust more convoluted nba cba stuff lolits where it pops up most but generally when you sign any player you have bird rights on to a year deal they get an ntc thats part of why you often see a lot of veterans signing year deals instead cause they want to be able to opt out and teams want to be able to trade themthey dont want to waste the asset when theyre already low on themim saying hes not very talented for a team that wants to win hes very talented in a can run fast jump high manner which is very valuable to dumb gms a good gm like brad stevens will demand picks to take on kuminga a bad owner like vivekishbia prolly think kuminga is a good piece to blow on warriors are selling to the dumb gmsim saying hes not very talented for a team that wants to win hes very talented in a can run fast jump high manner which is very valuable to dumb gms a good gm like brad stevens will demand picks to take on kuminga a bad owner like vivekishbia prolly think kuminga is a good piece to blow on warriors are selling to the dumb gmsthats exactly whats being discussed you literally just said the point of a trade is that the value of the assets are equal and im saying kuminga isnt worth the first and good going player golden state wants for himhe is a free agent just of the restricted varietythe one when he was leaving your team bozonow youre just being unreasonableits an example of negotiation you just dont understand ithes got to chase down those loose balls hes got to run the floor sprint the floor and if he does all these things then then theres no question he can find a better role and find a better fitif you dont hear his motor is in question in that quote im not sure we speak the same language if at my work my boss told someone else angrybeaver needs to understand that all these little things with customers will help us get big wins that means im not doing themyeah and most teams still play those players to increase their value which is the exact opposite the warriors have done with kumingayou have absolutely zero understanding of business of course the team has to be willing to sell but once you make it clear thats your only objective you lose all leverage why would any team interested in kuminga meet that asking price when you know the warriors dont want to bring him back you can just wait them out until they have no choice but to lower the asking priceno the suns didnt trade kd for jalen green lol kd wanted out and that team was about to cost the owners like million if they didnt make moves to get under and afford the repeater tax they also got a solid role player and a lottery pick back for year old kd the warriors arent getting a deal even close that returnno theres literally no teams with salary space in general theres two teams in the nba with salary space nets with million and jazz with millionthe teams that have interest in him dont have the cap space to do socough filipinos coughthats the neat part you dont have to theyre already among youso sad i wont be accepted to the lakerschiefspatriotsdodgers fandomtheyll toss in firsts to make up for itwell kinda no one was mad about it either being way above or below the market value at the time but everyone understood that it was based on the fact that he wanted a little security with his ankles being the concern but he still wasnt steph curry when he signed the extensionhe signs the deal and then the next season he was an allstarnba nd team and then the year after that was the mvpnba champion if he knew his career progression was going to go like that he wouldnt have signed a yearm extension the warriors were fortunate with his health keeping his value down and the overall timing of his contract vs the timing of his leapnah he really would have got significantly more if not for the injury historythe luck part was because he had a history of being injury prone and then it pretty much cleared up and wasnt a problem i dont know how much a franchise can develop a player to be less injury prone but if thats the case were lucky steph was a warrior and not a blazerray allenstojakovic if he was born in instead of probably would be someone like larry birdas good a shooter as klay is i dont think that he would have been fully unlocked without playing next to a healthy stephunpopular but i think that the narrative of spamming threes is better would shift to the harden rockets they were one of the first teams do it and maybe it would have boosted hardens status absent currymalik beasleyklayor drafting kd and making him play centeror even the cavs if the clippers dont make an absolutely awful trade which resulted in kyrie going to the cavs would bron go back to cleveland without kyrie therenot even close to the same thing the trade was widely panned at the time for the celtics the consensus was the cs were trading their stars for pennies on the dollar and there was no guarantee that the picks they received would even end up in the lottery at all in the draft jb was originally considered a reach at i googled mock drafts from that year and the first i checked all had jaylen doing th to the kings in the draft fultz was considered the no doubt prospect it was considered a massive risk to trade down and pass on fultz to take tatumit truly was a danny ainge masterclass that the celtics ended up setting themselves up the way they did and bucking the draft consensus to end up with browntatum like they did in most alternate timelines that trade ends up being dragan bender or kris dunn markelle fultz way different than the spurs being gifted the pick in those franchise altering lotteries if you let a random bum off the street be gm for the day theyre still picking robinson duncan and wemby in those draftsthe celtics make their own luck by sending their retired players to gm other teams and trade them kgworst luka is not worse and we hope steph and jimmy can stay healthythere was posts here earlier in the month where pelinka was trying to spread rumors to other gms that dfs wasnt fully committed and always nursing his knee injury lakers wanted him back for cheapdfs camp caught wind of it and called those allegations false dont work in the end as houston paid himlol no i dont weirdowarriors fans think rnba is rwarriorsthey should have come out of that draft with like wagner and sengun all time failure of a draft i still cant believe sengun was th overalli think they drafted based on need and the players they have they already have wiseman then they wouldnt take another center like wagner or sengun unless they already thought wiseman was a mistake so they drafted for other positions a forward and a guard which is kuminga and moodysadly hes not here either ripalso reality is that you are not adjusting your system for an all time player for some rookiewell moody and kuminga are lottery picks and neither is looking like a full time starter so thats pretty badbro what are you on about lol they had and in two years and they came away with zero rotation level playersthey didnt have any picks to develop except all the ones they missed on loli just dont buy it tbh i dont buy that the warriors offered that mil sure but i dont see how the warriors saw his play and his fit and offered thatno its a most a definitely that wiseman screwed himself over at the most minimum you would expect a javale mcgee role off the bench but the dude either had stone hands or just couldnt process the game fast enough to catch simple passes or rebound properly given his athleticism and sizewell he had a chance to do that in detroit they had the worst record in the league he was still a massive negative and never figured it out i cant blame the warriors for how he turned out he was given every opportunity he got the starting spot as a rookie they brought in jokics developmental coach for him and he still couldnt get it he went to the lowest stakes team in the league and couldnt figure it out there he couldnt stand out in the gleague either wiseman had both ends of the developmental spectrum and didnt producehes just not nba caliber no one ruined him because there was nothing to ruin in the first place his inability to grasp basic fundamental concepts is squarely on himall im saying is that if you never had a history of success got lucky with the covid draft and have never shown even promise of a serious nba talent you cannot blame the warriors for failing him theres been no player who warriors have rejected and then has gone on to thrive elsewhere just look around and youll see itoh wow thats the exact stats as trayce jackson davis who was the th pick in the draft wiseman played really mediocre even in college showed no elite skills and till date has no elite skills will not rebound cannot set a screen doesnt know when to roll pathetic shooting from all locations no post game no feel no effort warriors literally gave him a starting lineup opportunity all the injury recovery as possible and he just doesnt have it kuminga has raw skills just no bbiq and not fully rounded wiseman has zero elite skills theres a reason wiseman failed again at the worst team in the league pistons and will now likely fail with the pacersits more that a player that resigns with their team for only guaranteed year can veto any trade that season essentially giving them a ntc most players waive that right in the contract but if he signs a qo he cant waive that since its a standard contract for the qomost players sign a and in return for the po waive their right to veto a trade instead of only getting a year deal the ntc is for any contract with guaranteed year options arent guaranteed so players can still getwhat do you mean waste the asset for example i know the suns are offering royce oneale and grayson allen maybe they would rather have nothing on the books than those guys for more yearsthis started because someone else said if hes that valuable sign himiow sign him and keep him to which i replied that you can have a valuable player that doesnt fit your team you can also argue that hes not that valuable but i was responding to the concept that trading him doesnt mean hes not that valuablewith no teams having cap space no player is a free agent above the minimum or exception levels it all has to happen through trades has any rfa received any offers from other teamskd wasnt a rfa thenthat wasnt even a trade kd was going to sign as a free agent but then realized he could make more money in a st so they changed it but no other teams were involved but im a bozo you just dont understand itprobably because only one of us would come up with ithe isnt doing them consistently but everyone including jk knows that he is also and i think the organization still views him as someone who can and will growteams understand that some players dont fit when youre trying to win you have absolutely zero understanding of business ill never understand why people come to this sub just to insult others in order to feel better about themselves i hope it worked and yes i understand business but only an idiot thinks the warriors are trying to keep kuminga playing hard to get isnt going to work you dont think kumingas agent is talking to teams or is that not how business worksthe warriors arent getting a deal even close that returni never suggested they would but if jalen green has value in the nba so does kumingaright so who are they competing against to justify offering him mthen well call their assess outbetter not do so then just like yall did in the s lakers dynastyright its the definition of luck because no one could have predicted currys rise not even himself or else he wouldnt have signed that dealso basically warrrior are trying to force kumjnga into the same situation of signing a cheap rookie extension and then going from therewarriors were like triply fortunate signing your injury concern rook to a cheap extension only to have him become an all star is already super lucky but to then have him not only be an allstar but actually the greatest shooter of all time and having magically zero more injury issues forever with the very ankles that caused this cheap contract in the first place and then on top of that have the cap blow up right after that allowing them to pick up kevin fuckin durant for essentially freei would have thought someone must have sold their soul to the devil in that ownership groupfo for this deal but then i remembered oligarchs billionaires either have no souls to start with or has sold them long agoto be fair the warriors did have steph doing specific training to strengthen muscles related to his ankles with the hope that it would reduce his injuriesdrazen petrovic ok maybe not goat shooter but a very good one and i just want to imagine he lived and got to play a full career in this timelineyeah the presteph consensus was either reggie or ray and probably leaning the former until that kick out from boshof course ive got love for bird but i remember before curry the consensus were usually either reggie or ray agree on the klay thing without curryi expect hardens rockets would have won at least one chip maybe two depending on kd and okcbowie over jordan is indefensible but cmon you cant blame the blazers for oden over kd thats just bad luck oden was legit he just got hurtwhats embarrassing is you following my every comment in this thread lmaosome teams get top picks for a decade straight and still cant manage to develop any players my point is as you just said in a decade they only had decent first round picks thats not too many opportunitiespodz and poole were successes every team has misses with much better picks than the warriors moody and kuminga while not starters are also rotation pieces for us moody was playing with a torn ligament in thumb in this years playoffs its just that kuminga doesnt fit and the market is depleted of moneywell today there was a video on reddit with someone saying this was never offered so sr least that makes a bit more sense but i definitely remember the articles last year hahakuminga was playing really well before he got injured which is when they offered it after that we traded for jimmy who is basically super saiyan kuminga now hes a redundant much worse player than we just got so the offers went awayalso it was pretty widely reported he was offered around the mill a year mark last fall and turned it down think his confidence was shot by the time he got to detroit the guy has avg pts and boards in his career not worthy of a pick or to be relied on as a starter but he has a place in the nba i will say that i dont think he put in the work thoughsure buddy im not going back and forth over this but there was a reason he was the pick now his skillset eventually didnt align with that draft position and he never reached his potential just like a marvin bagleys skillset didnt align to his draft position but teams draft on potential so someone in the warriors draft room saw something in him instead of trashing wiseman trash the warriors front office i mean you yourself saw how bad wiseman was right so why didnt they see that it was so obviouswas when that happenedmaybe maybe nottelling the sports media what he did doesnt help the leverage at all neither is sending him to the deep bench will see with the new season where jk lands on the bench also doesnt help you dont deep bench a guy you want to developof course but thats why his value is in the dumpster its not like we are talking about a rookie or a year two guy this is year five for kuminga and if at no point have the warriors thought he would help them win why would another team give up a bunch of good assets for himi agree with that what the warriors are doing isnt going to work but your previous comments were you talking about it in a way that defends the warriors by asking dumb questions that many people have given obvious answers togreen doesnt have much value on his own he had value as a contract number and alongside a lottery pick and a good player in brooks you cant compare a guy who got moved with other stuff and a guy who teams are going trade for for also green started for a top seed and was a key player on that teamyoure competing with the fact that if the number gets too low hell just say fuck it and take the qualifying offer so that he cana get a no trade clause making us lose any valueb leavelol ok bro youre really underestimating how fickle and toxic your fanbase is but god bless and good luck to yanever been a fan of any bum ass la team id sooner be a kings fan than a lakers fanno its just luck dude strength and conditioning programs arent realwe all do one of the most brutal losses in basketball historyare reggieray really generally considered better shooters than bird or am i just being an oldhead and holding on to all of the ridiculous shots i saw bird hit when i was youngerisnt one of his legs like an inch shorter than the other blazers medical staff was known to be incompetent back thenyeah but no one talks about those teams like they do about gsw in terms of their organizationcuminga doesnt fit aka hes big bad lolit was jake fischer and i feel like he has bad info sometimes feel like hes more reliable than he used to but thats a bogus rumor you dont offer mil to a guy totally out of rotationi dont get him as the pick but there are busts every year lacob has been obsessed about an offensive big and was trying to make smailagic happeneven with wiseman lacob overruled kerr and the gm to draft wiseman i just wouldnt draft anyone with no feel for the game that said i just find it weird to blame busts on the team had bagley been drafted by someone else you think hes gonna be a big name hell still be ass because he just lacks the skills same story with wiseman whod have busted with any team because hes just straight ass so youre going to ignore your mistake and focus on my misunderstanding of what you were talking about kd has been traded a half dozen times sorry i couldnt read your mind of course but thats why his value is in the dumpster but we dont know that pulling off a st with a rfa isnt easy because of the salary matching we have to pay him a number he wants that another team will pay and for that team to have the correct assets that contract that wed consider to be a fair return its not as simple as arguing what his value is if he was already signed and tradable under normal rules teams might be jumping over themselves to get him even if another team was willing to pay him m they would need to have a m player that we would feel is worth kuminga in a trade and while those players do exist the other team needs to want to part with that player want kuminga and want to pay him doubleall true and if kuminga was already signed this would be a lot easierthat doesnt sound too badim aware how toxic our fanbase can be lmao do you think i dont knoweither way a sons fan shouldnt be talking about toxicity considering how you guys scapegoated trashed bradley beal lmfao also ayton the last coaches yall hadwell im glad you have standards but the same cannot be said for lots of other warriors fans who bandwagoned the lakers success before doing a once yall finally became goodalong with maurice stokes who else of note died mid career entire minneapolis lakers team almost went down in a blizzard around landed in a corn field in iowai think it primarily has to do with volume ray allen and reggie were both more prolific shooters than bird which obviously is partially due to the era being differentnobody thinks thatbut his talent was legit thats what i meant if you dont roll the dice with talent then you miss out on guys like curry who was deemed fragile and injuryprone i dont remember oden being hurt that badly during college or even if he was his upside was definitely worth the risk oden was consensus number one pick then any other team wouldve still picked oden or at least most of them anywayof course busts happen thats part of the game but to just discount wiseman like gs just put their finger in the air and selected a complete unknown at is being disingenuous in high school the guy was the gatorade national player of the year mcdonalds all american and tennessee class aaa mr basketball he also played in the jordan brand classic and nike hoop summit people had been following him for years and had tons of data on him and people thought he would be a star as far as his games at memphis the first were against scrub competition and the third was against oregon who i think was ranked he had points and rebounds but you have to take in consideration the ncaa had ruled him ineligible earlier that day after initially ruling him eligible so im sure he had a lot on his mind the school and his lawyers chose to play against the ncaas rulingdont get me wrong i thought it was stupid he left college the ncaa only suspended him like games or somethinghe couldve played a few more games before covid shut the season down he really should have come back for a second year but thats my point he needed more development and going to an experienced team with a coach that didnt want a young player can ruin your confidence maybe he was destined to be a bust who knows but to act like he has no accolades in high school and didnt play well those college games is disingenuous most of it is on him but gs played a role as wellhow many of those have been sign and trades which other trade would he been talking about when kd went for less than thismaybe warriors fans outside the bay but in the bay area its always been pretty diehard theres definitely lakers fans too but most of them didnt switch to the warriors when they got good issue is that theres warriors fans pretty much everywhere and they just bandwagon whatever team is goodhigh school accolades matter zilch mate wiseman was just physically larger than everyone at high school wiseman has a great agent because had he come back after injury hed not be a lottery pick he was dreadfulit was the covid draft no one had good data about players so the bust is sad but a tad bit excusable lacob did listen to his son and overruled the coach and every other actually educated voice all that said a player busting is rarely due to their environment if it was youd see flashes of good play when they move to another team wiseman barely looks like a vetmin player that isnt on the drafting team',\n",

all of sports if only dallas was paying attentionlol this trend of getting sports teams to pay for something completely unrelated is so dumb oh wow so generous to donate million to child care

community of sports and community leaders btw fuck nicoshould mean occupancy requirements for all the big ass women that waddle around down therethis is typical politics the child care program is sweetener and a shield if you dont want taxpayer money going to this arena then their defenders will say but theyre also paying for child care programs you see this happening with many things if you pay attention to mma boxing then a new proposed law that modifies the ali act is another good example of having sweeteners and shields to help the bad bill look betterah yes the old downtown revitalization scam that sports teams love to promote when asking for public money for a new arenapraising them for spending million for child care while taking million for the stadium seems like

arena will still be viable for events like concerts and such but it was built on land already owned by the county and used for the very large and well know stock show and rodeo so that as well it wont

tax for non residents visiting the city thats where the money is pulled fromtaxpayerstourism taxesvenue tax on all hotels and rental cars within a certain distance of the arena and entertainment districtsa taxpayers dollars will not fund the arena according to my source at the spursi think what the spurs want is to pay most of the arena and for the city to build the planned infrastructure improvements around it which includes a lot of city stuff like convention center improvements that arent directly of interest to the team splitting the arena money up between the infrastructure and the arena forces the city to stick to the infrastructure commitment and keeps their contribution the samea lot of us spurs fans do the current arena and location are not greatbut there are some that live near the proposed location that do not like the ideaabsolutely yes theyre renovating the area of the new arena already they just finished building a park there a new luxury hotel will be finished in march with a rooftop bar and a baseman speak easy on top of that its all right next to the riverwalk so its gonna be greatessentially its the spurs returning to where they played from same city blockdowntown park hemisfair i imagine most residents will welcome itas far as ive read the plan is to fund that m from tourism taxes hotels convention centers rental cars etc yes the opportunity cost of that money technically costs the citizens of the city but the vast majority of the bill will be covered by visitors to the city rather than straight out of sas taxpayers pockets per taxpaying household in sa over how many years thats not super insane right id pay that much to never have to wait in houston st traffic againwell its better than some teams that only pay and promise not to leavethe people of san antonio will pay rd of the cost to keep their beloved team and franchise superstar in san antoniothat seems quite reasonable if you phrase the headline as sa taxpayers are paying million for this project its a complete different vibeit would also be factually incorrect because the m is coming from tourism taxesa private entity invests b in the community and some clown whines about itrealistically about a third to a half of that will be sa area taxpayers doing staycations or otherwise using the downtown amenities being taxedboth obviouslywemby doesnt need that money to be loyaltourist taxes are usually required to be spent on entertainmentsports so no amount of your dogooder whining is going to change thati mean m theyre also giving to improve the city didnt okc tax payers just fund of that new arena and what else did they getare you saying the team is the only one benefitting from thisi would literally kill myself if the spurs left san antoniothe riverwalk runs through the northern park of hemisfair parkconvention center so itll be very very near the arena maybe meters awaytheyre still in just the inception phase of this no chance its done years from nowtheir lease at frost bank center runs through are you expecting them to break itmay as well just build the arena with no roofs at alleducation and healthcare are woke nonsense the billionaires earned their money so that means they get to spend the publics money toodo you think these republicans would spend that money on the things us libs want if you do bless your heart we arent last in education because of the stadium that takes decades of effort by republican leadership voted in by bigoted idiots we extended a one cent tax to make our city suck ass less the same weve done since it was bombed id rather have that than another tax cut for harold hammown privately owned arena it wont be privately ownedthe extended maps tax will continue to fund many different kinds of public works just as it has the first rounds yes some of it will go towards paying for the publicly owned arena to help keep the thunder in okc which is a good investment in and of itself the thunder are invaluable to the continued growth of the city but it will also continue funding parks infrastructure schools public transit and more its also worth noting that this an okc level sales tax it is not a state level initiative whether or not the state properly funds education child care infrastructure health care etc the city of okc is doing what we can both with the public works covered by the maps tax and elsewherefor example the city of okc has passed measures to increase funding for education but that cannot make up for the state govt actively slashing the states education budget or for ryan walters losing us some significant federal funding by refusing to fill out the renewal forms out of stupiditymaliceobviously this isnt ideal i wish the state would get its shit together and i wish the thunder ownership would pay more into the arena so that the maps funding could be used elsewhere but i dont think i can find any fault with the city of okc continuing to try to make itself as good as possiblei think trying to renovate the area to become san antonios version of the fort worth stockyards would be cooltheyll probably get rid of freemanso would that mean the spurs wouldnt need to go on their big road trip when the rodeo is ondamn thats messed up i didnt realize that to distance themselves from his problematic ass they should give the pistons the trophy as a demonstration of good faithwhat did he sayhorrys hip checks a chiropractors office fuck robert horrychucks churrosyou got da recipe wats the hol upbalanced as all things should beother teams get free churros when home team scores we give free shots of that liquid gold from denmarkand san antonio lacks them loltransitparkingstret changes has to be a priority for this i went to two spurs games and loved both but waiting for an uber after was hell the traffic flow was atrocious i may have to suffer through watching the wizards play basketball but at least i can get on a train and get out of there in less than minutesdhonest question what else did thunder give the city of okc along with the arena fundingwell i need to double check but theres a chance this isnt actually true the city of san antonio was exploring funding their portion via a tax on hotelsrent a carsshort term rentals which is actually how they funded the last arena again not sure if that changed but that would be better than say a tax on actual residents also while i typically disagree when this is usedthis proposal is about much more than the spurs arena wont go into all the other projects but it would totally transform our downtown and make it much more livable as a resident id pay a bit if it meant we actually had a fun downtownwhich is not unreasonable the fact of the matter is that sports teams add value to a city i read some survey from i think minneapolis where the average resident said theyd be willing to pay a year or something to have the nfl team and that was regardless of whether they were a fan of not teams should put a lot of skin in the game but im cool with this splitim not into how us city government works so i might be wrong but wouldnt that be the same thing as resident taxes just moving things around do us cities have separate budgets one for resident taxes and one for nonresident taxes and spend them separately seems tedious but thatd be the only way itd actually matter if its still the same budget for the city from all taxes only using nonresident taxes in this case would just result in other projects using more resident taxes to make up for itwhich i kinda dont get the itc is gone makes sense to build it there and im guessing alamo dome will be turned into a big parking lot with the land bridge connecting itwhich is smart i hope other citiessports teams take notice id like to see more than of construction contracts going to locally owned companies but dont know how feasible that isthese taxes make it more expensive to visit the city depressing tourism overall and eventually costing residents taxes suppress economic activity it may be worth it in this particular case short term cost long term gain etc but theres no free lunchimprovements to the city what else is tax money for and like others have said its actually coming from hotel convention money etclook at the total costs the issue is that the arena itself is estimated to cost to billion so that million could be about of the total cost the other million going into the entertainment district is a small fraction of that districts projected total costs as well that private entity is probably rich enough to pay for the arena themselves but like most private entities they dont want tonot sure how thats related to my comment but thats not correct governing bodies have a lot of leeway on how they spend their taxes theres no hard and fast rule about that a lot of places putting taxes on hotels and vacation rentals are then using that money for affordable housing because they naively believe that hotels and vacation rentals are why the rent is too hightheyre taking million from the city while building a business district that they will profit fromisnt some of the money from this going to help with some renovations for it so i guess maybe that was part of the deal that they can get out of their lease earlyanother few years and hell need a space helmetoklahomans are just temporarily embarrassed billionairesfair enough you make a pretty good point if i were held captive in oklahoma id probably want a basketball team too and unfortunately for us haters youve got a really competent franchisethat would make sense move all graduations to frost bank thencorrect aside from tradition i guess a case could be made for having no major events in the city while the rodeo is going on but i doubt itthat trophy is too symbolic if you look at our trophies side by side there is one that is noticeably more tarnished and has scratches on the net sectionmakes sense that it came from the most physically demanding finals we played inkind of lightly trashed duncan more or less calling him overrated claimed that parker and ginobili both messed with his ability to get bigger paydays because of their poor play called the spurs boring but not in a positive way wasnt the most damning stuff but hes just kind of consistently made little comments to make it seem like he was a little bitter about his time there despite the fact that by most objective measures the role he was asked to play in san antonio and the results from that role were huge for his careerchucks double fisterseverything outside of the q experience at the current arena is bad shit part of town not easy to access no food or bar scene nearby no good hotels nearbygetting the arena out of that part of town will alleviate a lot of problemsthe promise they wont leave lolwell the city owns the arena and profits that come from it what the split is here is a questionrings erneh mil okc just renewed the current penny tax that was in place since the swho do you thinks pays the tax on hotelsrentacars if nottaxpayers loli assume youre trying to distinguish local taxpayers from outoftown taxpayers but theyre still taxpayers and its at best an accounting trick the money is still coming from public fundsthe value isnt much economic value in that sports teams are a shift in consumer spending rather than growth the amount the public spends on this deal wont be less than the economic benefits this has been proven time and againsports teams add value to a citythis is a pretty hotly debated topicdo taxpayers get a cut of the profits and rise in team valuethe population of minneapolis multiplied by bucks is they tend to have a bunch of different buckets of money and the way those buckets can be used is pretty specific and restrictedthat tax specifically is authorized by the state legislature only for a small subset of expenditures stuff that increases tourism essentially the legislature wrote in an exception recently that applies only to san antonio it doesnt say that but its got population density restrictions that make them the only candidate that lets them also use the tax on hotels within three miles or so of the arena for arena construction and infrastructure improvements so sort of your kind of stealing from the tourism fund but its not like that tax money would gone to fixing roads or whateverin terms of implementation from what ive heard it will apply across the board because the assumption is most people staying in hotels renting cars will be from out of town but that can always changegiven that hotels and rentals cars specifically require id its also not out of the realm of possibility that they go based on that persons residency but that obviously creates a headache for businesses in the areai have heard tho that the chairman holt has been adamant on sa taxpayers to not front the remaining cost so most of the yr long wait has been figuring out funding methods taxpayers also dont wanna fund itedit want to clarify since someone else posted below a good point the tax will apply to whatever the final radius is determined to be around the arena not even completely city wide or state widethe assumption is without a team these extra tax revenues dont existthe alamodome is being renovated as part of project marvel and the preliminary thoughts are to make the dome parking lots into mixed use buildings i live in the area and want the project to happen but am not looking forward to the construction and really hope it doesnt spread to the point where i get an eminent domain noticealamodome just got a face lift this year right before hosting the final four so it probably isnt going anywhere any time soon looks like the plan calls for demoing the current parking lot and installing a parking garage which imo is a good call either way kinda wish i still lived near cesar chavez hahathis is what a lot of cities do or are doingits not that smart because a lot of places will run into the issue where the tax discourages the activity which lowers the amount of tax revenue collected at that point the government body will need to figure out how to make up the difference tangentially sacramento in particular paid for the new stadium via a split the city took out bonds and are paying back those bonds by i believe parking meter revenue happened and that crashed parking revenues so the city had to cover its obligations by taking money out of the general fund eg tax money thats supposed to be used for other things all of this of course is completely avoidable if ownership pays for the new stadiums themselves it could be worse since oklahoma voters voted to raise taxes to pay for like of okcs new arena even though the ownership is plenty richremovedbecause youre whining in an attempt to be a dogooder and youre wrongtbf they are saying they will invest m to help renovate sas convention center renovate the alamo dome the citys major concert venueimprove civic projects like roads build a pedestrian land bridge connecting alamo dome area to hemisfair park where new arena will be above a major highway that makes downtown very unwalkable so yes they will benefit a lot from some of these but lots of benefits for residents toohow dare a business make a profitwe should make winter coats out of their fucking skinrobert horry is the real babyfaced assassinthis was basically my entire experience as a tourist ill get a hotel near the arena no good hotels ill walk over instead of getting an uber long not super pedestrian friendly ill head over early and get dinner beforehand to beat the rush few options nothing else to do i loved my visit to sa but yeah its location is worse than any other arena ive been toyeah frost bank is in a strange location for an arena to say the least this new location would be perfect for tourists and itd be right off the freeway so i imagine it would be easier for the fanbase to accessthat isnt even necessarily true they can leave if they pay b within the first years and scales down from thereyeah to your point its still taxpayersbut if its not sa residents i feel like thats fine i think thats a notable differenceonly when you define value in strictly financial numbers its a lot harder to quantify the more intangible benefits and most just dontno but proposals include a new pedestrian land bridge connecting downtown above a major highway m to help improve child care in the city renovations to the convention center frost bank and alamo dome along with some civic improvments like roads which are proposedi mean sort of i think this is of the areas where the idea of trickle down economics sort of works right having a sports team in your city will help drive tourism help prop up local businesses help tax receipts etc the teamteam owners might profit more but the clearly are a benefit to the local economyi was living in brooklyn when barclays got built and the area around barclays transformed overnight in terms of restaurantsbarsstores popping up and succeedingnot everything is about money and making a profit sports are massive for a citys cultureno but they do get the benefit of attending games and the increased foot traffic for local businessnow if the teams are doing everything they can to make it unaffordable to attend games and the surrounding area is still a shit hole then you got gotyes and over a year lease it is true that would be badif you look at the total then youll notice that upwards of of the arena cost will not be paid for by the private entity is out of which is a lotinaccurate on both accounts once youre old enough and pay enough attention to politics you know all the tricks they pull to try to win votestheyre making a profit through a million gift from the tax payersyup its been a complaint by locals for a long long time most of your season ticket holders live at minimum minutes from the arena and most everything worth staying out for is minutes from the arenaif you come back before the move you should eat at magpie by far the best restaurant on that side of town about miles from the arenawell that aint happening lolto me its a distinction without a difference the point is the opportunity cost of those funds not where you trace the specific source versus tracing it to some residents taxesehyou can do all that and more w the mil theyre giving awaywhich is more than a lot of arenas in a bygone era publicprivate partnerships are goodexcept to virtue signaling dogooders who dont understand that this money has to be used on such projectsremovedagain do you think only the business benefits from thislike nobody in san antonio gives a shit about the spurs i agree although the thunder are valued at b an expansion team for seattle will probably be b so i suppose in some cases it could be worth but i agree it wont happenthats fair and in an idealistic society id agree with you but as a san antonian lets be honest people and our leaders regularly resist any sort of change in this city the chances of that money getting used on something like education transport improvements things we needtheyre basically and if they tried our governor might even strike them down depending on what it was for the fact that san antonians would get something for them a revamped walkable downtown with an entertainment district at no cost to locals and we get to keep the spurs from going minutes north or to vegasill take it i wish the bar wasnt that low but you take the wins when you can get emlol this city turned down rail and numerous improvements countless times the only way we getting those civic improvements downtown is through sports ball hahapublicprivate partnerships are not good when all the upside goes to the private company plenty of studies have shown that the public at large does not benefit from funding new stadiumsmany modern teams pay for the arena themselves publicprivate partnerships are the bygone era the warriors for example paid for their billion arena themselves thats of the cost for those doing the math at home is larger than its times larger too imagine if you had apple the warriors have that is simply not an accurate reflection on reality dont know what else to tell you feel free to debate me if you can be civil about it either way have a good fridayyeah some of these contracts you see are just egregious like the municipality funds the stadium and the primary tenant in the team doesnt pay any rent which makes the funding even worseit isyour head is so far up your own ass that you dont realize this simple fact tourist taxes have to be used on touristrelated activitiesif you spent as much time reading as you do trying to sniff your own farts you might understand thatdont even bother with that guy kings bro theyre just trying to get a rise out of youlike i said if you can be civil about it then we can debate i see no value here and i will simply reiterate that what youre saying is not accurate or factual at all have a good oneyour kind of smug virtue signaling while being objectively wrong is worthy of scorn',\n",
       " 'playmakerthey just drafted four guards something tells me they dont see cam thomas as their franchise playerlowe hit it on the head again this week when discussing all the hubbub he said to make it to the league you must have an astonishing amount of selfconfidence and to remain in the league you must have an astonishing amount of selfawarenessis playmaker scorer a new term or does he mean the most elite playmaker scorerseither way hes not an elite playmaker in the nba he a bucket thohe should take the qo if all hes getting offered is a yr dealinvent a new term and declare yourself best in the league at it interesting strategywhy would zach lowe do thisthe microwave scorer who cant do anything else on the court facing the same fate as nfl runningbacks value is going extinctwait grimes is looking for a year really hes only good when hes the only optionjust take the money and improve dudeball hog this dude lashing out at zach lowe was so funnyhe doesnt deserve a big salary but the ntmle is a slap in the face for sure imothe days of role players making million are over because of this new second apron stuff teams have to make sure their max guys are really max guys all the money seems to be going to them nowthe michael jordan of alonzo triershes a good spark plug scorer but any team paying him m are just screwing themselveswhat a career this kid has had so far gets drafted during the kdkyrieharden era doesnt see much playing time yet manages a gamewinner against the knicks at msghas point games in a row and then gets benched by hc jacques vaughnthe only guy on a tanking team whos guaranteed to score the team is not interestedi guess teams dont wanna pay big bucks to somebody they havent seen contribute to a contender but m is definitely a slap on the face and with a team option too yikescam thomas hey fischer ready for the f wordone of the most delusional players of all timethe future euroleague alltime top scoreri forgot who the player was but this reminds me of the time someone went into negotiations and the agent declared the player as the next micheal jordan so thats how he should be paid the team responded by saying the next mj doesnt get traded multiple timesedit i want to say the player was ron mercer and he was signed under master ps agencyi didnt realize cam knew he could pass the ballon the real his scoring production is great but you need to be a twoway guy if youre looking for more than the max mle with the apronsthe volume scorer who offers little else is the most overvalued role by players and this cba and free agency is a stark awakening for themdelusionalman it sounds fun being delusionaldetroit where you at this our th manlove him or hate him i think years and million with a team option is kinda disrespectfulclassic case of a player overvaluing themselves i respect the confidence but you need to have an understanding of what you can do vs what teams wantneed you to dogood for the nets im glad theyre standing firm after dealing with kdhardenkyrie for so longdidnt realize all these numbers everyone is citing are from a game samplei thought this mf was on the nuggetsas a cam thomas box score watcher cant he get something like m per year numbers look kinda goodi blame zach lowe sthats what thomas is worth hes a full ntmle guydude is above average thats itplaymaker does he have a child who he is arranging friend meetups forhes michael carter williams from our process yearsno need to bid against yourselflmaoooo m aavwho the f does he think he is a wnba playerthe new dion waitersaight reskinned jordan poolei feel like fischer is stirring the pot with bs even cam thomas has said himself before he has to work on his playmaking where in the world would he now say hes an elite playmaker i feel like all these cam thomas reports are honestly to slight him none of the other free agents have signed and are holding out but cam thomas is the only one with shit on his name arguably one of the quietest of that bunch when you take into consideration kuminga etcgrimes giddy are both looking for mil a year and we havent heard a single peep about it they arent worth that much either yet all we keep hearing is about cam lol i know feel like reporters have a beef with this man assists per game while also being a low efficiency high volume scorer oh and hes a bad defender somebody back up the brinks truck and get this guy a max alreadyheadline is cam thomas among the most delusional people on earthi would love him on the magic but only as a microwave man type too bad he thinks hes a superstarbattle of the delusional kuminga vs thomasim surprised teams arent trying to get him as a spark plug off the bench seems to be the perfect role for himdelusional lolmakes tons of sense to me i do think hes worth more than that but they dont want him there so they drafted multiple guards and made a low offer why pay someone what hes worth if you dont want himand yall think kumingas getting a bagit must be absolutely wonderful negotiating contracts with massive narcissistsdelusionalbut is he the best male model actorwhy would he take the qo its only mil there must be a team willing to pay more than that for a year if he wants a change of sceneryfor cam as a person i think its a great attitude and i think for a pick youre thrilled to have someone like himbut you kind of hope the mindset can be compartmentalized when it comes to the business of contracts you cant act in your own interest if youre being that unrealistiche can easily get at least mil a year on the open market dudes a flamethrower on offense and there should be plenty of teams looking for an upgradereverse schroedersomeone pay the man cam is too good to let gopick up that qualifying offeri am not a cam thomas fan by any means but this legitimately does feel disrespectful because its effectively a year deal even like million is not going to hurt your team in any significant way my guess is they want it to be tradable but no one is giving up anything of significance for cam thomas and someone on that team has to eat up usage and at worst its a big expiringid rather have grimesweve seen this story too many times the arrogant one dimensional scorer archetype the ones thats become selfaware carve out moy type rolescareers the ones that dont are out of the league quicker than you imagine whether i want to pay cam for his ceiling or his floor im not going above m perin my opinion he actually is a million level so its sad this is getting drawn out very easy to dump on him right now but hes super underrated and has great potentialwild disrespectfuli want to see him on the bucksdoes cam thomas overrate himself yeah absolutelyis cam thomas definitely worth more that mil with a single year of player control absofuckinglutely frankly thats a pretty insulting offerthis year is such a terrible year for free agents seeing their peers secure the bag the last couple of years only to be treated as your value is a bag of chips must hit differentpelicans please sign this foolthomas is a sixth man archetype and should be happy with m a yearputting playmaker was required by his agent to publish this storyi just remember this dude rolling his eyes at steve nash bros delusionalrookies earning moresomebody need to sit him down n be honest to him bruh is a ball hog and is caked up he needs bigger pantsits interesting how it only takes one comment from zach lowe to convince this entire sub that theyre now experts on this guy they dont watchs game youd think he was some generational chucker if you only got your basketball knowledge from herehes not lightskin enoughm for cam is a jokei know i know recency bias but i still really like him id get flamed if i put a number on him of what i would really pay him under other cba rules he would probably be paid differently compared to now but i also think that he has the most potentialimpact on the nets roster if he would be on it rn nobody they drafted will probably be that great besides maybe drake powell who i see as a rotation player on a contender on his prime while everybody else that they drafted just screams backupwow this is maybe a dirty way for the nets to force him to leave anyone with half a brain knows hes worth more than i have never heard his name before this moment does that say more about me or himhe had the second most assists on his team not counting pgs smakes so many plays for himselfdoes taking a shot count as a playelite has lost all meaning its just used for anyone nowadays like elite defense just means plays defense because nobody plays defense so he thinks since he passes the ball hes an elite playmakerwhen i think of passfirst team ball floor generals i think of cam thomasi am sure he meant play maker as in creating his own shotyeah its clear they view everyone as expendable and are looking to draft their new franchise building blocks something tells me they dont see cam thomas as their franchise playeri saw some folks on the nets sub worrying about losing him for nothing and honestly i dont think thats the worst result in the worldchuck call them studio gangsters he just gets the ball moremore precise to say that they drafted guards drake powell is more of a wing and is not a lead ballhandler right now that said danny wolf can dribble but hes definitely not a guardpowell is a forward saraf is and demin is people acting like they drafted a bunch of tiny pgshe doesnt have to be though he can just be a good young player that we continue to develop he fits our timeline but hes in for a huge reality check he wants mil but hell be lucky to get half of thathow much would any team in the league pay a developing player with glaring flaws pgs potentially depending on how the nets decide to use deminpowell and wolf are not pgsthen you sign him to what hes worth and trade himnone of them play the same role as ctnone of them are any goodi think that may have been lowes cohost but yeah that was a good nuggetalex caruso has entered the chathes not even an elite scorer he is very inefficient i know hes on a bad nets team but he just chucks his shot selection is horridhis reps just adding ad many buzzwords as they can to describe himhes probably going to do that earn m his qo instead of m hit ufa in a year and find out that his market is gary trentmalik beasley instead of jordan pooletrey murphy i expect the cam thomas is seeking new representation tweets in a couple of weeks after his agent tries to talk sense into himhe should take the m and if hes worth it he can be a fa next yearnew cba is brutal for this type of player he could very well be in the gtj market category of player next yearhis career earnings have been million on his rookie contract hes being offered a deal that is more than double his qo in year one he could go from potentially earning million in years to making million on his qo then facing a free agent market that is pretty strapped alreadythe problem is that the nets have no incentive to compete and a crop of five new rookies most of whom play guard so if he takes the qo and signals his intent to bolt in a year then he could very plausibly get buried on the bench and have his value deteriorate even furtherkuminga should do the same hes already turning down what theyre trying to get him to sign on the short term and theyre delusional in his trade value they dont want him and he doesnt want them he already turned down that bag last season just take the qo and then have the freedom to go to a better situation for yourself next year only gonna continue to hurt your development your future career earnings etc riding the benchim the best off the backboard spin two times catch and passer in the leagueman zach lowe is ruining cam thomas careerso monta ellis a traffic cone on defence a below average height shooting guard that cannot playmake cannot defend and a similar point to marcus smart rj barrett and tobias harris in the mid sthe only thing he can do to a high level is create his own shot and get bucketssame as only power hitting no defense hitters unless you elitepretty sure thats why dallas dumped him tank commanders should be cheaper than thatgrimes is definitely not going to get yr from the sixers and will probably sign a shortterm deal for cheaper with the expectation they might move him later on so he can try for a bigger payday elsewhere hes good but maxeymccainvj all on the roster makes him the odd guy out in the long rungrimes plays defence really well actuallyhe wants that patrick williams chicago bagteam option seems like a problem though he would lock himself to unwanted place for more than a year that waynah the team option sucks better to take the qoi got dogged on a couple weeks back for saying that cam thomas has a bad attitude the guy has shown again and again that he thinks hes better than he is and doesnt have much desire to improve the poor aspects of his game he has the mindset of a gleague player who will never see an nba court because they think scoring is enough the only difference is that he is enough of a bucket to justify an nba contracti dont think ive seen a single nets game recently whats this drama all about he doesnt pass big ego can anyone explain plsbecause he defended himself i dont think cam has a future here but cmonunless youre the raptorsdeletedsmall bucket getters that dont pass or defend well are just not good for any type of team trying to win jamal murray is maybe the closest you can get to that archetype but he is not a bad playmaker and he plays with jokicand from the team that has the most cap space in the leaguei dont think his ego will not allow him to come off the bench which sucks because i think hed be the best th man in the league if he accepted ityou want to pay him mil to be the th manthats what its going to take if he was willing to accept a reasonable contract then hed already be resigning in brooklynif this is what brooklyn is offering thomas then god only knows how bad the offer is the warriors are trying to get kuminga to sign lol at least cam is giving the nets minutes jk is keeping that bench warm waiting for a butler or curry injury againhes not that amazing and no other team has cap space so the nets are capitalising on their leveragei mean is it theres no market for him and his trade value seems to not be much his stats look solid but teams are clearly worried about an undersized guard who cant defend shoot first and needs the ball in his hand to be use at their max efficiency thats a steep hillits a prove it kind of dealthe nets have much more leverage than thomasthats what hes worthseems a bit of a bizarre offer his qo is m and guarantees him ufa next summer he clearly thinks he can outperform m so why would he agree to the team optionif they see him as a sixth man thats a completely reasonable contractwrong cam i made that same mistake when i saw that trade thread what have you seen these two play basketball their game is totally different poole is a willing passer and he mostly shoots s ct is an iso player whos shot diet is mostly drives and middiesthis guy clearly havent watched jordan poole or cam thomas playcompletely disrespectful to jordan poole who not only worked incredibly hard to improve and become a key piece to winning a chip yes he stopped giving af after the punch but he was very good before and has shown signs of life recently i feel like fischer is stirring the pot with bs even cam thomas has said himself before he has to work on his playmaking where in the world would he now say hes an elite playmaker i feel like all these cam thomas reports are honestly to slight him bro he started this mess by going after lowe despite the fact that lowe spent most of the time defending him he took issue with lowe quoting the general consensus ie most peoples opinion if he had bothered to listen to lowe he would have seen he was defending him years over well the thing is no team is offering him that lolthats malik beasleys money id rather have malikyeah admitedly i dont follow the nets that closely but even if all the bad things people here are saying about him are true m seems like the minimum for him hes hes actually not doing himself justice hes first not counting pgs hes th on the nets behind schroeder dlo ben simmons and um killian hayes assists to turnovers if he is great playmaker im a millionairethis single stat from the season where he played the fewest minutes in his career is clearly the best evidence and everyone who has watched him for years is wronganytime he scores in isolation its basically an assist to himself toolets be fair he might pass when hes triple teamedwhich this most recent draft indicates they will not be successful doing so any time soon lolmaybe not the worst result in the world but also not something a good franchise does in their situation theyre not replacing him with someone better and he is clearly talent while flawed player he is worth holding onto not at his salary demands to see if he can grow or change into a solid mangetting no assets for him is kind of a bad result even a nd rounder in a st or something would be positive good franchises dont let players like him walkwho does chuck call studio gangsters the four guards that they draftedif the goal is to trade him then ideally theyd want to sign him to less than what hes worthhis value is the amount of cap space teams that can trade for him will have in the next two years if a contender can clear mil in a trade thomas will get that otherwise the nets cant overpay this dude and hope to trade him lowering the amount of teams that can actually take him onthats what they are trying to dobut no one really wants a score first guard that doesnt play defense unless youre hyper efficientyup they actually pass the ballexactly they are all better long term investments over a guy that maybe becomes a good man at besthow the fuck are we supposed to know if any of them are any good if none of them have played a single nba game yet lmaothen theyre about to give cam the maxwas it sorry mahoneynot the problem with him he was above average in efficiency this season the problem is he is truly one of the leagues worst defenders which is why his impact is so minimal on the court despite the gravity he hashes not very inefficient his efficiency and scoring is fine but thats all he does and if thats all you do and you want to be considered a star you have to average more than ppg i need at least and probably before im going to call you a star without playing any defensehes currently not good enough to be a top three option on a contenderhe has an elite bag for sure id argue his inefficiency has more to do with how much teams were able to game plan for and focus on himhe had a ts this season at exactly league average efficiency and again thats on a bad nets team put any level of talent around him and that number is likely higher its not easy to score at such high volume with no good playmakers around and to have solid efficiencyppg on ts in minutes is pretty good defo not a shot chucker he holds the ball way too much though hes th in usage and like th in ppghe can probably get a multiyear ntmple from someone next year which would be myr without the second year being a team option plus hed get it from a team that actually wants him around if he takes the qo and gets traded then the team getting him can keep his bird rights and offer even more if they want hes not worth m sure but hes worth myrsi think the minimum they can offer is a year deal so it would have to be a option a deal just sounds too advantageous for the organization where cam could just sign the year qo gain a no trade clause and then be a ufa next summer whereas a puts cam at the mercy of the nets who can just trade him away in january while cam has no sayteam option not player optionyeah hes gambling on getting a contract that pays him better than m next yearthey owe their pick to houston via swap so they cant afford be bottom bad a year from nowtaking the qo is what nerlens noel did got injured within months he declined a m bag and proceeded to make m over the rest of his career taking a decent contract take a shorter one if youre betting on yourself m is enough money to fix up your life forever and both nets warriors will gladly trade him if kuminga signs a contract he is trade eligible on dec which is barely months into the seasonthey are definitely not delusional on the trade value he will get some value if they can sign him to a or something until he signs hes not worth muchlou williams is the archetype cam thomas and tobias are way better shooters than other too lazy to actually look up stats but you can just see it watching their gameshonestly at least cam scores consistentlytbf if patrick williams is worth millyear cam thomas is worth at least millyeari love cam but yea im surprised with how few people realize how many red flags there are when it comes to his attitude imo i think its one of the biggest reasons the nets are so hesitant to offer him anything substantialhe has the mindset of a g league player who will never be an nba player only difference is hes actually an nba player did this make sense when you typed itgood stats bad team guy puts up points low efficiency bad defender he thinks he deserves a massive contract because he can score and is young critics disagree and call out the flaws in his game which he snarkly replied that he is a great playmaker he is notzach lowe literally praised him for minutes immediately after the consensus comment thats why ct comes off as so brain deadhe didnt defend himself for shit zach lowe specifically said positive things about him and reported the general consensus around the league and this idiot goes out and says fuck you zach lowe bad lookis saying fuck you defending yourselfnah the nets have their first rounderhell probably get less than m in the open market if the nets rescind the qualifying offer what a tough position hes in id like to see him on the pacers though would be interesting to see him paired with nembhardif they want to preserve their cap management they cant be giving out patrick williams type contracts to guys who dont deserve it letting him walk for nothing may even be a blessing in disguise since it would free up opportunities for their draft picks this year and in the futurewhile i agree m is a bit cheap hes also not a max player or even close to it probably what hes hoping to get just because we have the cap space doesnt mean we need to overpaymil is absurd he either signs with the nets for less than mil or a potential pistons sign and trade that work around our mil trade exception plus maybe like an extra mil if we added sasser both scenarios cam gets under milthats is truei thinks probably in the million range given that chicago is only offering a year for giddey id give more money to kuminga given that weve seen the best of thomas and its ok so far but we havent seen the best of kuminga which can be found on another team that isnt the warriorsi dont blame them for doing that tbhthe only potential drawback is if this turns into another kuminga situation where he says fuck the nets and wants to leave next year after betting on himself for a yeari know but i can disagree with it all loldifferent flavour same result of empty points on bad efficiencyi think cam is noticeably better than poole already on offense i would love to hear a warriors fans opinion of poole thoughcorrectregardless this is lowe and thomas the fuck is every other reporter now coming at thomas for when they have nothing to do with itoof thats not ideal what are teams waiting for hes the real dealim not his agent btwwanna bet on it now compare their usage lmao zach lowe honestly had the perfect analysis on this guy half his his assists come from being trapped and basically having no way of getting a shot off so he passes out not to mention how generous assist bookkeeping is these days cam has almost no playmaking abilitybehind hayes and dennis who was traded in december and calling yourself a good playmaker is crazy lolhmm maybe he was counting simmons as a non pghe is worth holding onto not at his salary demands to see if he can grow or change into a solid manthats the issue right now they want to pay him like a th man he wants to be paid like a key starter on a contenderbeing willing to lose him for nothing puts the nets in a stronger bargaining position to secure a decent deal i rather they take that position than becoming insecure franchises trapped overpaying a player who will likely be a bench guy on a contenderheadline doesnt make it seem like he thinks of himself as a man also not something a good franchise does in their situationbut neither is paying cam million he may be mad but he is not a franchise guywhat can we do if he wants a max and hes worth maybe mil and has noone else who will pay him in rfanobody wants him to take a qo but its rare a guys stats are so far from his value around the league and hes got a bigger head than most we would rather not pay him than pay mil for a th manif they pay him mil and then keep him and then doesnt grow then they have to worry about trading him and possibly getting shitty contracts in returni think theres tremendous value in being one of the few teams in the league with cap room i dont know how valuable cam thomas will be in years when the nets might be able to compete in the first round or how valuable he would be in a trade can you get a nonflawed less talented player back if you signed him at years m aav what crappy contract do you have to take back if you trade him to a tax team for picksnot as his salary demands yeah thats the whole pointi mean i think it would be better to get something for him but i dont think its the end of the world if they get nothingi genuinely dont think hes that valuable of a playerhes a one dimensional heater type guy whos a ballhog and offers you nothing else the nba is valuing these types of dudes increasingly less you gotta remember that a sign and trade requires the other team to want the contract the guy is attached to and i doubt anyone at all doesgood franchises arent enacting st penalties to get cam thomas either its not the nets its the marketchuck say he scored a lot only because he was the studio gangsters who was the only option on a bad team so he got all the shotsso offer just under his value instead of insulting himi dont think any contenders are lining up to pay cam million a year lol payton pritchard who i think is better for a winning team is only making million thats cam thomas money not pluslol their guard prospects are egor demin and nolan traore theres a high possibility those guys never even reach the levels cam thomas reached last yeari actually think it was michael pinacorrection it was rob mahoney he was above average in efficiency this seasonoverall no league avg ts cam thomas ts in the context of guardswings he prob is but theres no easy way to find thathe played like games this seasongood luck trying to convince these little dweebs who dont watch games and jack their micro dicks to stats theyre too dumb to fully understand in contextwhy does he need playmakers around him when he himself is already an elite playmakerit doesnt always work that way dude loves to take really tough shots no guarantee hed work well around other very talented players id take him in a heartbeat on the warriors thoplenty of players have scored significantly above league average efficiency on bad teams just off the top of my head paolo wemby carmelokobe in the past cade etc it is not even uncommon in fact its probably much easier to score at high volume on the nets since you will get many more shot attempts and nobody is scouting for the nets you can see that most of the starters on nets have aboveaverage ppg for their careerhes not even top in time of possession theres a difference between shooting it a lot and holding the ball a lotwho else on that team especially after the trades in december do you want taking those shotsthis sub will never understand how usage works unless they have changed this rule with new cba i dont think this is true if he takes the qo that would qualify as a new contract and his bird rights dont go to the new team which is why you see during the deadline how some people have an implicit no trade clause due to them losing bird rightsi think this is likely the case because the nets are offering him a contract at the ntmle level when most teams offering these extensions at least try to go above that line so the player wont be able to get that in fa the following yeargotcha but still worst case hes getting m you look at guys like gtj who held out for m on multi year deals and ended up with league minkinda wild houston has the suns unprotected first round pick toowhats the difference between someone doing a st for kuminga right now paying him mill or whatever a year versus them doing their own deal with him now for the same salary and trading him at the deadline outside of the salary take back issue gsw has there isnt one so no teams arent gonna suddenly start offering unprotected frps and good young players for a guy that every team in the league knows the warriors dont want on their team they dont have any leverage in the trade negotiation talks with other teams every team knows kuminga doesnt wanna be there they know they dont want him there so theyre not gonna give them a crazy value for him plus its for a guy with low bbiq no defense no jumper just gets it going downhill offensively as his bag thats not even a valuable asset if he wasnt distressed from how they treat him look at all the things josh giddey offers a team as a player and hes having trouble getting paid or making something happen besides if im kuminga who already turned down a real bag last off season with how the warriors are treating me it they dont st me then im taking that qo and picking where i go next year and screwing them better for his long term potential earnings anyway since hes just gonna keep rotting value away on the bench waiting for jimmy or steph to get hurt to get real minutes and showcasingit must feel amazing to get drafted to franchises that over pay their players patrick is on an insane contract and cam cant even get one offer sheetif pwill is worth cam is worth i dont think any other team in the league gives pwill that contractif williams is worth then every third player deserves the max but not every fo is as incompetent as chicagoit did because you changed what i said im talking about how there are a ton of gleague players that think they can get into the league by scoring a lot the truth is that scoring can come from anywhere hustle defense and getting your teammates involved are all far more valuable to a team than just being able to put the ball in the basket cam thomas just happens to be very very good at putting the ball in the basket i was noting how it seems like hes shown no initiative to actually improve the other aspects of his game because he thinks his ability to score puts him above the restnot only that but lowe is well connected with the brooklyn front office i dont doubt that the consensus that he gathered might have been from thomas own teamthey owe their pick to houston via swap so they dont have this long runway to be bad they need to be careful loosing a ppg scoring for nothing not saying he needs a yr deal but hes worth myr over or yearshes worth at least myrs and its wild that theyre offering only m guaranteedcam isnt accepting that which is the whole ordeal hes either getting mil from brooklynnot happening or taking his year qo hes not entertaining the current mil offer or anything close to itthe fact that you think games from a yo is peak thomas and that kuminga has more potential to me is wild also playing with draymond and curry and butler should help kuminga not hurt himsure i was just saying what it seems like to mehis free agency came at a horrible time he could have gotten a poole deal in the pastagain thomas is average nba efficiency and above average for guards its also a miracle that hes so efficient considering how many grenades he has to chuck and the degree of difficulty on a lot of his shotsefficiency is not thomas problem its the way he stops the flow of the offence by playing isolation ball his inability to pass out of double teams and his below average defenceit really looks to me like youre not that familiar with his game and its not that im some sort of cam thomas apologist you can review my post history to see that ive been rather critical of his style of play and his role on the nets but you cant just be spewing random bullshit about the man thats just wrongnets he helped someone up thats an assisti dont understand this comment why does it matter that schroeder was traded do you think this person means total assists and not per game even if they did the two started in the same amount of games last season for the nets its per game not total buddyhe playmakes to himself for the shothe led the nets in assists though people dont always consider jokic denvers point guard even though he is being willing to lose him for nothing puts the nets in a stronger bargaining position to secure a decent dealrfa put them in the bargaining position theyre in the type of player he is thth man is the exact type of player that is getting squeezed in this new cba the timing is even worse for him no team has cap space to offer him anything more than the mle and i dont even think there are many teams with that nets have all the leverageand theyve basically signaled they dont care about him at all they offered a deal that is very very team friendly and would probably just use him as a trade chip at the deadline if he accepted hes better off taking the qo barely and testing fa next seasonth manth starters like naz reid getting milyear rn i dont think the nets want to pay him even thathe is a rfa they hold all the power frankly their reported deal is worth much less than an average man and they should offer him something legit like and if he doesnt like it then let him test fa and match if its reasonableand time will tell what role he develops into he is and maybe he develops into an allstar he has the talent and maybe he joins a contender with an established backcourt and they say to him youre the man and you can run the second unit however you want and his role is effectively the same the point is he is young and he is talented and they shouldnt just let him walk and they should probably lock him up on a medium length contract something like yearsmdid i say to pay him million hes not going to get that in fa and he is rfathe hawks added naw for m per year for years cams upside is much higher than naw who is a pure role player he should go for years mtheyre not competing within the next two years unless they see a big jump from one of their players most likely ct if he doesnt take the step but youre able to get a star another way you can trade him as an expiring in two years their cap space has to go somewhere and a medium term deal gives them the flexibilitysurebut some team could use a guy whos a microwave scorer off the bench the bigger issue is his demeanor and thinking that hes an elite playmakerscorer the right coach could potentially get him to buy in and be a th man microwave guy lots of teams need guys who can score in bunches when starters sitif youre cam and are on that nets team i bet it would be hard not to a ball hog given the rest of the rosterdefinitely true too the new cba has fucked many midtier players a few years ago he probably would have gotten an anfernee simonsesque deal from someone his attitude isnt seeming to help eitherthe problem is he thinks his value is mm a year and nobody else around the league is trying all that hard to steal him right now so were still at the figuring out what his value actually is phase in cams mind the qo is an insult but if nobody else is going to offer more why would brooklyn bid against themselvesi like cam thomas hes a good scorer and for the th pick in the draft they got good value out of him but every team in the league has a player as valuable as cam thomas you can replace cam thomaswhats he worth though i think m is kind of fairwhat do you think his value is i think its mil but seems like you think its closer to mil which is just not truebit unfair to compare him to prichards contract which is clearly very team friendlypayton is underpaid relative to his value thomas is actually worth around mil as a fourth option scorer that can pop into the if everybody could pay pp money for that value they easily would in a different cba thomas would get paid this money easily now but the nets and utah are the only two teams holding cap space so cam cant go out and get paid forcing a rfa signing that would be ideal for him i dont watch enough thomas but he is sorta like maxey slightly okay size for his position who can light it up maxey got paid a max so thomas really shouldnt be in the sub mil category of guardsagreed if this report is true i dont see anyone offering more than this m annuallyi would say it depends on the teams needs miami for instance always has a good defense but the offense has been lacking in recent seasons due mostly to a lack of shot creators we likely just addressed that issue with norman powell but i could imagine a timeline where miami is willing to pay him m a year if we could send terry out in exchangewhich is why they drafted egor reaching his ceiling is a more valuable nba archetype than cam pass first pgs will always have value zero defense below average efficency scorers are arguable the least valuable players in the nba especially if they demand starter timemoneywas it sorry becki did it once i think the average for a guard was and for wings and bigs are at like now if you look at the difference between guards wings and bigs before pace and space leading to more than half the bigs just being rim running only dunk bigs the difference only used to be like to between wings and bigsweird maybe databallr is wrong because it says cam thomas has rts either way were talking about ts the point remainsnow do league average for players averaging a similar ppgits like or something for guards i just made a comment about shaedons the other dayheavily propped up by free throws to his efg of is well below league average he shot okay not really revenant when his offensive impact has always been pretty good while his defensive impact has been horrible his entire careeris that you cami mean its kinda like a resume hyping ur self up with a lil bit of cap here and therethats the crux of this argument is he scoring so much because nobody else on bk can create their own shot or does he have a high usage because hes a ball hog the only way we can ever learn the answer is if he plays in a winning teamsituationyep youre right bird rights dont transfer via trade in this scenarioworst case hes getting m team can decline the optionbecause gsw can just match what they offer now we dont know exactly what gsw wants not sure how youre saying theyre delusional cam averaged and williams averaged guess who got paid lol i hate the bullseven more head scratching is nobody was fighting to sign pwill at that timedumb af move out of nowhereim with you on that point nothing ive seen from him screams winning piece on a contender undersized scoreonly guards are not the meta anymorethats already on the high side of his production value in the previous cba even if we believe his playmaking numbers but hes also uncooperative and on the small size for a sg that doesnt play dwhen a team sees you as hard to deal withlocker room poison that sinks your value even stars like harden had to take a paycut to hop over much less a nonstarhe has no trade value at myr so i can see why the nets are trying to get a lower contract on himmight as well give him the nets offer with a player option insteadplaying with curry helps kuminga playing with butler and draymond does not help kuminga at all bad fit im not saying thats peak thomas but im just emphasizing that kuminga still has stuff that he hasnt been able to show with rhe warriorswhats your take on this contract situation as a nets fanim just hatingmy bad i was thinking total assists also yeah your right even if it was total assistsi was being stupid with that commentdeletedcant compare a forwardcenter with a small sgmyr is good starter sg money and that often includes them being great ball handlersdefenderstheir reported deal is worth much less than an average man how many backup shooting guards make m a year no one will trade for him if he gets a myr contract if they see him as just a th man thats starter level money even malik monk who had better production than fox during his contract year didnt get a m bag and monk plays chunky starter minutesm is in the ballpark for a backup shooting guard on a contender and hes a rfa like you said they hold all the power no point to bid against themselves my only nitpick about the suggested contract is the team option is abit too much and it should be longer duration he is rfaright so they are not likely to lose him he is likely going to take an offer he does not want so sign offer sheet or otherwise the only way they lose him for nothing is if somebody terribly overpays at that point you let him goi would much rather have naw for m per year than thomas hes absolutely going to be more of a winning player no defense bucketgetters are the most overvalued player archetype in the league hes never had an above average ts he doesnt play defense and hes not a particularly good playmaker either despite him trying to sell himself as onehis upside may be higher if youre only looking at side of the ball but being a dimensional smaller scoring guard vs an off guard with positive contribution is as a defender who can scale up a bit on o is probably more important to winningnaw is also a more desirable player who is an excellent value and any team would want very few if any good teams want a small sg who isnt a great passer and cant defend look at anfernee simons and how little value he had colin sexton jalen green is a solid defender and he still was pretty undervalued on that contracti do think cam is maybe getting underrated when you look at his tape and efficiency its pretty impressive as the option but he is such a hard fit you cant be an onball only scorer and be that bad of a passer and defender and offball scorer its hard to envision how hes part of a great offense or great defense wo major stylistic changes even if his own stats are gawdy even with a devin booker type of development of his passing game he is still so small for a sg defensively its hard to see how he becomes a option for a good teamdoes their cap space have to go somewhere i hear this take a lot and its not strictly speaking true it they dont use at least of the cap it gets distributed to the players on their roster the nets are at around of the cap now ct taking the qualifying offer would get them therei dont think cam thomas can be the best or nd best player on a team who wins a first round series and i think that facilitating trades with extra cap room at the trade deadline could net more assets than whatever you trade cam thomas for and even though there will be a few more teams with space next summer theyll have the most space a lot of teams have been negotiating harder because free agency is less of an option with so many teams operating above the tax line it only takes one team to play hardball and the nets could be there waiting but every team in the league has a player as valuable as cam thomas you can replace cam thomasyeah the unfortunate reality even if every team in the league has a player as valuable as cam thomas might be a bit of hyperbole is that his archetype is currently and its been trending this way a while the least valuable archetype in the nba a scoreonly small guard that does nothing else at a high level for an nba playerhe should be insulted and if you guys are going to tank for draft position just let him pick up a mle somewhere else instead of doing him dirty while waiting for the inevitable and hurting his careerwith a team option on the second year at what he could find from another team today he should tell the nets gfy thomas is actually worth around mil as a fourth option scorer that can pop into the im pretty iffy about him at m and m is a straight up overpayhis archetype is the least valuable archetype in the nbapayton is a better pt shooter and a better playmaker who is ok playing his bench role which cam isnt unless cam is ok with that type of role he is going be making less money that payton no one wants a mid tier scorer who thinks hes the best player on the court maxey and cam arent comparable in my eyes maxey is leagues better than him as a playmaker better shooter more willing passer and a better off ball playerya but hes not a below average efficiency scorer for his position and he scored at that level while attracting the second most doubles per game in the nba his main issue is his health his efficiency will no doubt leap when he doesnt have to take the most difficult shots on the court because hes surrounded by nobodieshe played games all of his stats should be taken with a heavy gain of salt players averaged ppg last year cam was ranked th of those players in terms of tsgetting the to free throw line and making them is an assetobviously i wish but no i am just genuinely tired of these souless losers who have no real anything about them as a person and who can only get off to a tangible nunber ruining sportswere not talking salaries nobody can offer much were talking trades playerspicks for kuminga we know theres offers for that as sign and trades now that the warriors dont like but those arent gonna get significantly betterchange if they do sign kuminga and try to move him at the deadline the situation has changed kumingas value around the league and what teams are willing to give up to bring him over is what it is and it doesnt help the warriors in negotiation talks when everyone knows they dont want him and he doesnt wanna be with them so nobody around the league needs to budge in making a better trade offer cause of the situationhe didnt just get paid he got million and doesnt have to worry about free agency for a while no wonder cam is seething at media membersi am holding onto my patrick williams stock i think hes going to be a salary dump to san antonio okc or miami and they will turn him into a d menace on the wingi could see him being a sixth man on a defenseheavy team but thats basically the peak role i can imagine for him other than what hes doing now put up meaningless buckets on a tanking teamshooting guards just dont have value in this league unless you are truly elite very easily replaceable wings are very hard to replace which is why even mid ones have a lot of valuenets kind of doing him dirty here they dont want to keep him they just want him on a contract where he becomes an tradable assethmmm id say that brooklyn has pivoted hard to a new direction because of the hiring of jordi fernandez as head coach jordi clearly has a vision of what future nets basketball should look like the clear inspiration is what indiana played in these playoffs extremely quick motion offence multiple ballhandlers and playmakers using high frequency passing and dhos to confuse the defence and then use that confusion to get open lanes open threes or lobs it seems that both sean marks our gm and joe tsai the owner have fully bought into that plan and thats why we drafted ballhandling passers in the recent draftso how does that factor into the cam thomas contract situation well cam is a good dude and an awesome scorer but his game is based on dribbling isos and backing smaller guards down his game is incompatible with what the trio of jordi marks and tsai want to build in brooklyn that doesnt mean that marks would not want cam on the team but it means that hes not going to go out of his way to pay him above market value the fact that no teams currently have the cap space to offer thomas a contract that hed be happy to sign except the nets means that marks doesnt even have to match these offers ct is a restricted free agent so hes free to lowball thomasi get why that makes cam so frustrated i think he deserves to be paid around the milyear mark and he thinks its probably more than that but hes just not going to get it on this market and marks is not going to give him that sweetheart deal because thomas doesnt look like a player that has a place in the new brooklyn systemthe contract that was offered to cam years at mil aav is a very low offer for a young player of his caliber the length is also telling because the nets are currently set up to have another huge salary release in the summer of that year mpjs and terrance manns contracts expire and we should once again have the highest cap space available in the league just in time for a free agent class consisting of joki and antetokounmpo thats clearly the plan and thats why cam only got offered a year deal marks wants to see if ct can adapt to the new system if he cant hell increase our cap space in if he somehow can then thats the actual year he would get paid by the nets to stay on and be the year veteran for all the young gunssomeone admitting they were wrong on the internet i cant believe my eyesdont call yourself stupid thats for us to sayincredibly mature reply for rnba never thought id see the daydont worry itll be ok youve got lukasaying that with texas education is braveits more about quality of player than strictly position naz is flat out better and more impactful than cam thomas im actually curious how many good starting sgs are making milyear its likely more than that for a good starting but depends on roster salary concentration how many backup shooting guards make m a yearthis is from chat gpt so it may not be totally accurate but these guys vaguely have fit that criteria recently or come close to it jordan poolec j mccollummalik monkjosh hartnorman powellterance mannbogdan bogdanovigrayson allenim not sure how much scaling naw can do on offense hes never going to be a primary ball handler and yah offensive contributions as a primary ball handler is the most important skill its why trae young and harden are so valued despite their negative aspects on defense cam has the skill set to get there while naw doesnt will he get there almost certainly not but its worth punting a larger contract on for the nets in their position in case he does theyre not a winning basketball team they arent even close i could see him develop into a slightly smaller better shooter demar derozen who was a black hole early in his careeryour second paragraph is exactly what im talking about he is extremely flawed but there is so much raw talent it is worth taking the punt on him to see if he takes the next step will he probably not but if you can lock him in now a couple of years he might be nets arent in the position to play winning basketball they need to find a coreplayer to build around ct and naw arent those guys now but if you were to make a bet as to who that could be in to years you should always bet on ct if this was a playoff team then im always taking naw but thats not who the nets arewhat could he find from another team if a team really wanted him they would have offered something by now as far as we know he hasnt received any offers i honestly dont see any team offering as much as m let alone the range he wants especially with the current cba he doesnt offer much outside of scoring hes a good scorer but hes not elite hes a really bad defenderits a coin flip on is he doubled bc his team is ass or because hes a suspect passer and id argue his main issue is his attitudeno way is this the drchizwhat actual report has come out about an offer ive heard rumours but nothing concrete for kuminga that got turned down outside of malik monk possiblythe flip side is we clown on the nets for years for overpaying a nonstar huge amounts of money and staying a terrible franchise both sides are just acting in their best interestthis is just nba business nothing dirty going on its obvious what both sides want in fact its very transparenthope it works out for cam on the nets because i really think if he just hones in on more team oriented play hed be absolutely lethalthere are dozens of us in our s dozensdeletedi was alluding to the size premium and skill flexibility when mentioning positions had to be specific with positions since the th man role can fluctuate greatly in value depending on the teamwhy even participate in a discussion on a forum if you arent even going to write your own commentsyeah thats a crap list far more starters in here than backups and a bunch of them dont make myrchatgpt is horrible at interpreting things that require any amount of nuancewait youre jumping all the way from someone whos a chucker who doesnt swing the rock to excellent players who are both better scorers and significantly better playmakers than cam those are completely different players cam has more in common with sexton or jordan clarkson as d combo guards than someone who can orchestrate an offense so theres reason to even bring them up when comparing to cam even when harden was coming off the bench he was a great playmaker for being a guard who styled his play off of ginobili more than being a lou will type gunner cam is one dimensional because his only skill is scoring something that you either have to be elite at on a level like kd who still brings more as a defender and playmaker than cam even someone like bradley beal who is a much better playmaker than cam didnt bring enough besides scoring to be successful you jump to talk about offense of primary ball handlers but the guys who you mentioned are playmakers when cam is not demar becoming a better playmaker is an anomaly compared to most guards who start out being poor playmakers but demar had a significantly lower usage level than cam did through his first seasons to be a playmaker making a statement that he can be a slightly smaller demar is ignoring the fact that a big part of what makes deebo a better playmaker today is his size and athleticism allowing him to draw people in with the drive and see over many of the guards defending him with his size the size is also relevant for him because demar can and has lined up at in the past few years while cam being a small guard whos not a playmaker is confined to position which limits the teammates he can play withnaw is more valuable because he was cast as a th man scorer type earlier in his career improved in defense along with being being able to guard and scaled down his offensive role to be someone who can be a connector and do and d wing play with a bit of scaling up when presented with advantages that is more valuable for most teams than a small gunner who cant playmake and cannot defendhow much would you pay cam though thats the question nets arent shopping him but if he wants jalen green money hes not getting it and thats so likely to be a bad contract you no longer have upsideif you want to bet on his upside you need to not pay him so much that even his top like outcome is still an overpaythats the mle half the teams have it most need scoring bad enough to offer itcarter saric couple second round picks now changed to a protected frp those are confirmed offers out there and kings aint budging no monk offers or proposals kings said get better elsewhere and it would appear no one around the league values kuminga muchknow he may just be able to be signed in fa next off season only other rumor is some grayson allen package from sunsknowing what the nets want instead of getting upset he should try to negotiate and get the best deal he could out of it if he can get the offer up to at least m years hell still end up with a better year total than if he takes the qoacting like people in they s cant be immature lolright but many spurs fans are texans youre speaking about lakers fans im speaking about spurs fansyouve just proven youre not the sharpest tool in the shed thoughdont you know its a small market with no international connectionspersonally i dont see it and i think that since no one has offered it yet that they dont need scoring bad enough out of curiousity what teams do you think would want thomas and what kind of contract do you think hed warrantwell i get why we dont take that it really does nothing for us idk why you think the fo is delusional when its an offer that is garbageyeah i know but it helpsthis contract from any team looking to make the playoffs because thats what they can offerthats why this is the offerbecause theyre not going to get a much better offer anywhere else let alone what they expect unless the bulls or some other team pull a very stupid move which they couldi dont think a lot of teams think he has value on a good team they think he is good stats bad team guy that will have difficulties fitting in with on team where he isnt allowed to shoot every timegotcha i must have misinterpreted your first comments where you said to offer just under his value instead of insulting him as you thinking m annually was an unfair offerfor most teams offering or more for thomas would put them over the st apron and nd for some i dont think adding a cam thomas really puts a team over the edge enough for it to be worth restricting their finances which is why i was wondering what specific teams and offers you were thinking ofteams wont be offering the mle just because they have it though also the m is specifically the nontaxpayer mle and most teams dont have it the hornets bulls warriors pacers are the only teams left with their nontaxpayer mle the pistons used theirs on levert but could sign thomas and stay under apron the rockets used most of it on dfs the clippers used theirs on beal and lopez lakers used theirs on laravia and ayton pelicans used of theirs on looney the blazers used theirs on lillard spurs used most of theirs on kornetlike thomas these rfas giddey kuminga grimes really dont have any leverage right now realistically i think only maybe the warriors and pistons would be potential options for thomas given their roster situation and cap situationsedit not to mention tax implications im not sure many of these fringe playoff teams have owners that are willing to take on more taxes to add a cam thomaswhich is why theyre keeping him if he plays even decent next year desperate teams always call at the trade deadline hes freaking and top of athletes for nba players itd be beyond stupid to trade him for pennies right nowkerr is going to play him nowhe did last year before he got hurt he was averaging like mpg then when he got healthy again we traded for jimmy this trope that he never got minutes is wrongbut you still have jimmy sooooooothis trope that he never got minutes is wrongof the top picks in the nba draft the only player with fewer mins per game is zaire williams zaire fucking williams and he only plays mins per game lessso your point that kerr didnt play him was wrong he got minutes and was playing well id be happy for him to go somewhere else now that he could play more ive always liked him but hes not gonna play next year much barring injury so your point that kerr didnt play him was wrong dude he got dnps in the playoffswhen people say kerr doesnt play kuminga they dont mean zero minutes it means he gets jerked around isnt trusted and averages far fewer minutes than any other prospect of his calibersigh yes after we got jimmy he doesnt work with jimmy and dray and we were down the stretch with them kerr stuck with what was workingi swear people should just keep their mouth shut sometimesyou know there are years of him getting shit minutes before jimmy rightand again i said is kerr going to play him for this year meaning when you have jimmyi swear gs fans are dumb as hellyou didnt say for this year go look at your post kerr was playing him and he was playing well earlier in the year end of story just admit you dont know whats happened with the warriors its fine dudelook at you proven wrong and you run away coward kerr is going to play him nowwas my op notice the word now look it up in a dictionary then you came back with this stupid shithe did last year before he got hurt he was averaging like mpg then when he got healthy again we traded for jimmy this trope that he never got minutes is wrongthen i replied withbut you still have jimmy soooooooholy shit youre stupid afcoward lmaoyour post makes no sense leave basketball talk to the adults kiddoim not surprised you dont understand it',\n",
       " 'god what a wild season that was degree of difficulty on most of those shots was insanedidnt he have game winners that season which was the difference between the first seed and the eighth he seems a pretty solid choice to meas a kobe hater i gotta admit hes so scary to watch its so annoying how much of a threat he was against any other teamthose offensive rebounds were clutch afsay what you will about the dude but that mid range fadeaway was a thing of beautyhe has admitted he shoots better when losing than when tied in these scenariosi like how even when he misses it usually worked out pau put back like of themwhy were there so many moments like this in one season lmaowatching that bucks arena brought back memories playing nba live with robinson and ray allen time flies mani love how he doesnt hesitate to take those shotsif haliburton isnt available i guesswtfc dude was nasty and so fucking goodi want igoudalakobe is the best irrational shot maker in the history of the nba its the one skill he has above lebron and even jordan the only person that comes close is steph and while steph is better at taking and making the impossible kobe can take and make any impossibleirrational shot is alr absurd and now count that of the misses were followed by putbavks lately cause of the gravity that kobe held yea thats nutsheres a filter for shots to tie or take the lead in the last minute of the game minimum fgaif you sort by fg kobe sits at on attempts notably above kd curry mj and others its impressive since he has the nd most attempts nd to lebron but really we should begin the narrative that b diddy is the most clutch player since they begun collecting these stats in and they got the bucket on of the misses so for the lakers in those situations apparently you definitely fucking dokobes one of them players where you dont give a flying fuck about efficiency idc if he went all game in the th quarter clutch time this mf was the scariest player to watch when he plays against your team the amount of daggers ive seen this dude hit is insanepeople always talk about kobe as a ball hog but he still would keep his team close in games and everyone knows with the game on the line theres nobody you would rather have a chance to win the game at the buzzer kobe was automatic in the clutchdo i want kobe taking the last shot yesyes kobe like brady doesnt win every last secondlast drive but every time they dont im surprised it feels like an anomaly thats the kinda guy i want with the ballhands in his face no foul baiting clutch shootingpure mamba skillsand i wonder why people dont think he is not top all timeartest putback still haunts me man steve nashs last chance to make a finals runthis is my childhoodits not even just game winners dude was so clutch throughout every tense moment entire th quarters when his team really needs a bucketclutch goes well beyond game winning shots or the last minutes of the gamepretty damn clutch honestly probably shouldve passed on a couple of those triple teamed drives but otherwise bravothe shots against the kings and raptors were going in no matter whatas a person who watched all of these live fuck yeah the run he was on was insane my favorite is how he did the raptors that seasonperfect player for late game situations a guy who can create his shot from small micro movements can shoot accurately from multiple body angles can play onoroff dribble and has a razorsharp edge to his playing mentality its as if the guy was made in a lab for these situationsonly a few guys come close to kobes shot creation jordan comes to mindyes he was the best v player in the league at that pointimagine him today with better spacing kobe had an insane clutch run best season he ever played as soon as he guaranteed the lakers would make the playoffslolhe missed the game winner against the bucksso in ot he went to the same spot to nail ithuevos grandesalso funny you cant post anything about kobes greatness without someone bringing up colorado lmaowhether i want it or not probably wouldnt matter to him anywaysyesthat triangle was slicing and dicing on some of those possessionslove seeing whos on that memphis team its cool to know theres still players conley still around who played against kobe that yeareasy yesi want the kobe bryant last shot that changed the rules of the nba all last second shots are reviewed now that shot the impossible onethank you for thismiss vs raps terrible inbound pass as a lakers fan watching kobe shoot i rather have him shoot than anyone else even double teamed he gave u that confidence in him that hed make the shotit wouldnt matter what i want mf taking the shot anywaythat one against milwaukee where he missed it to win then did the exact same shot to win it in ot is something only kobe would do lolalways his ability to make impossible shots without fear of missing is unmatchedalmost every miss is put back in probably from the overwhelming effort being put into doubletriple teaming kobehe is so good honestly more like if you only count when he got the last shot under seconds some of the misses and a make were shot with more than seconds or in a situation where his own team had enough time to get another legitimate shot also shooting while inbounding with isnt exactly fair to compare either just amazing stuffyes even his misses put them in a good position for the offensive board people looking at advanced stats way underrate kobe todayas a laker fan of course but if i wasnt a laker fan and my team was up point in the final play of the game with the other team having possession of the ball the last guy i want to see with the ball is fucking kobe bean bryant i dont care about the stats i dont want that mfer to take the last shot because you know he will drill the dagger straight into your heart without hesitationthat ronron putback was something of legendthe world is healingidc if kobe is shooting during the gameid still want him shooting the last shot timesi want paul pierce to take the last shotthe no boxout from the suns is a memory etched into my childhooddont be sleeping on derrick fisher nowlink we soundalways interesting seeing how opposite he and lebron are in these situations lebron always makes the statistically right play eg collapse defense and dish out if he doesnt have a good shot but half the time you wished hed just risk it all himself especially when his teammates missed open looks kobe would always go for it solo but half the time youd wish hed just pass id assume lebrons approach wins more games on average but goddamn kobes is so much more fun to watchits refreshing seeing a kobe thread on this sub where the top comments are analytic nerds telling us a guy who made over all nba offensive teams defensive teams and all star appearances wasnt great because of some statsclutch of course i want kobe bro he is kobe bryant ffshell yeahim not a kobe fan like that but sometimes i think i fucking love kobe man and honestly considering the circumstances on most of these shots theyre not as bad shot selections as his detractors would like you to believekobe was on a mission during this time he wasnt fucking aroundi loved the moment he and meta shared after that putback at the end what a season that was holy crapkobe is the guy that you should pick if your life relied on a last second shot to wintheirs also the clutch free throw shooting he was like one guy id never have doubt at the free throw line no disrespect to lebron but its a huge night and day difference in confidence level when hes at the free throw line at the end of games compared to kobe i remember the one time he missed a clutch free throw line was at a miami game and he came back on the floor later that night while tnt was still doing their post game to practice his free throw shootinglooks like i do about half the time lolalso this video helped me realize thingssome of these situations were impossible sec situations or really tough situations period and pau gasol was clutch as fuck kobe solid choicethe answer is haliburtonwhy the hell does this sub hate on kobe so much he is top all timeid take haliburton over kobe taking the last shotyou live and die with your best player thats how i see it i dont want no supposed superstar passing off the last shot cos cam reddish was open in the cornerman defense has changed so much with less than seconds on the clock no one is just gonna let the star player get the open pass in the backcourt nowadayswhy werent defenses doubling him everyone knew he wasnt going to passif i have gasol on the glass then surethat last one triggered my ptsdfuck youlooking back at that raptors season i am not sure why i was surprised that chris bosh left for miami fuckin antoine wright was playing crunch time minutes for that team at the yeah he was really good at them i guess it depends on who else i have on my teamabsolutelythe beauty of those laker teams in was the offensive rebounding from bynum and gasol even if kobe had a bad shooting night you still had to secure the rebound or else the big men will just gobble it up i wish more current teams had a similar set up where they put pressure on the boards instead of just prioritize fast break defenseoffense that was pretty good also it shows clutch gasol putbacks of the time it works every timei want iguodala or haliburtonyeskobe was a certified kings killer and bibbys face elbowerim impressed you found so many nice recordings of nba that doesnt look like they were filmed on a potatowhat a season he hadgasol hahahawho would make this video and cut the sound outin any era i prefer larry bird taking the last shotof course i do those are all insaneone word yesthink of it like this making that many when every person in the building knows who the ball is going to is beyond insaneim arent his clutch stats for his career pretty badits awesome when a stadium erupts because you made a final shot its even more awesome when a stadium goes slient because you made a final shotits sad when a stadium goes silent because you missed a final shot its even more sad when a stadium erupts because you missed a final shotigoudalamost of the shots he missed still had a great outcome and to me that is what counts its not about whether he made the initial shot but also about whether he made the next one or put his teammates in a position to clean up the missinsanethis is footage from the nba season and the nba seasonlow key phil jackson has sooo much to do with this these end of game plays are absolutely the best he had in his bag especially coming out of timeouts obviously it takes skills to make these shots but he set up kobe and mj in their best spots i am talking knowing kobe is hot from catch and shoot off the bounce drive ect phil knew the flow of his teams to execute the right play at the right time also the way the plays were ran showed they definitely practiced this situations daily which a lot of coaches dontid be like kobe wtf was that shit except for when he makes it rather have luka but next to him kobe everytimeisnt this the okc make put the lakers up and la won the game but the tally goes from to kobe my guy next to mj but he definitely didnt mean to bank that shot no one is shooting line drive bank shots from in front of the rim last player to really master the bank shot was tim duncan from ft stepping out on the blocks with that said kobe was one of the best clutch players of his generation what post mj elite player was as clutch damn sure not lebron nor steph or kd kawhi was clutch player but like kobe in my opinion my knicks guy brunson is a mfer dallas luka was a mfer kyrie is a mfer dame left his clutch gene in portland but hes on the way back he had a few in milwaukee but it wasnt the same but in terms of stars from that late s early s draft classes i think kobe was the most clutchso he shot but of his misses led to points off the rebound to either take the lead or tie it yeah ill take thati remember some of those pau was such a perfect fit there for kobe tooyes you know hes never scared of the momentim on itcredits pitlessballclips hes on your team you dont really have a choiceabsolutely not his actual on gamewinners is terrible he just always took themsay what you want about numbers and shit but the lebron clutch shots compilation is like steps bellow this shit it is amazing to watch even for the th timelove kobe but haliburton had last shots that was also impressiveim taking lebron over every version of kobeas long as it isnt in the playoffsif you look at his overall numbers no kobe would take the last shot over guys with an open man under the bucket thats part of how he played the game but his clutch time was not great dame steph tyrese brunson so many players in the league today are a better option not even including historical players like ray allenlebron would never make any of thesei was arguing with a friend cause hell take bron to take the last shot over kobe mj steph lolbiggest take away god i miss seeing pau gasol on the courtafter watching hali this offseason this looked bad in game of the finalspretty sure you want tyrese haliburtonoverglorified chucker who doesnt know how to take good shotsid take luka over him every timeyes next questionwhat about the times he drew a foul in crunch timeno the lakers win percentage cratered that season whenever he took two dozen shotshe was in game removeddepends on if were playing in coloradoa lot of his teammates are wide open on thesecurry probablyi mean if its him or curry im taking curry kobe or lebron im taking lebron kobe or any of his teammates im taking kobe kobe or klay thompson klay kobe or kyrie kyrie kobe or kd kd kobe or duncan depends on distance but probably duncan id probably choose kobe over every other player thoand still ended up at fg with a bunch of them being from thats about as clutch as you can realistically hope forand all of them were with a broken finger on his shooting handbucks defender in the nd and rd clips here was inside of his soul with the pickup point at halfcourt lolinsaneit was kind of ridiculous that some of these games came down to the wire we should not have needed a game winner against the likes of sacramento toronto and milwaukee at that time of the misses were on double teams and ended up leading to a basketheard about this too literally won them the finalsalso their good start in the beginning helped as well they really struggled once they got to januaryand they said its a negative for his mvp case because the games shouldnt have been close dude would back himself into an impossible position pick up his dribble have no outlets and then still rise and fire to hit it im a hater too but his difficult shotmaking is up there with anyonethe particularly difficult part of trying to defend him was that even though you knew he was going to shoot it you still had no clue what the fuck he was going to do because his bag was so deep and he used all of it there was a statistic regarding drives and how pretty much everyone favors either left or right to a strong degree like lebron went right of the time kobe went left and right it was a complete mystery what he was going to do with the ball but you knew it was going to be amazingthats the jordanesque goat aurahaki scares the enemies even before the game startsi know this is a glazing thread so ill catch some heat but iirc kobe was a shooter in clutch shots even before his achilles tear he just took all the clutch shots so he has a lot of highlight ones was just an outlier year of varianceobviously great player cant argue with chipsthat is part of kobes impact everyone knows he is taking the shot the defense puts too much focus on him leaving the rebound up for grabsthese lakers teams were built like the iverson team in length height and defenseron artest saved our asses on multiple playshadthats what happens when everyone is focused on you makes it easier for your team mates to reboundpau was a great rebounder he was a guythats why kobe was so clutch everyone was so worried about him and forgot there was other players on his teampeople underrate the lakers frontcourt of that era when pau bynum and odom were healthy and in form that team was almost unbeatable they had too much size and skill on both endsleague is so stackedlakers winsdallas winssuns winsnuggets winsutah winsblazers winsspurs winsthunder winsidgaf what anyone else says i miss the old purple and greenkobe is the greatest ridiculous shot maker of all time and its mostly his doing do i pass out of triple coverage fucken pussy you shoot the ballnot an option mamba mentalitykobe has never hesitated to take any shot lolmy favorite was the milwaukee one where he misses in regulation and then goes to the same spot in ot and nails ittatum doesnt hesitate to take them either just to make them sometimes lolstraight up not even thinking about his teammates depends which month of just to add some numbers he went for on shots to tie or take the lead in the final seconds of the fourth quarter or overtime across both the regular season and playoffsjeremy lin with the fate of the universe on the lineone thing to note in that query is so also counting shots that could be the result of constant lead changing in the final minute of the game so it might even count multiple from same game there isnt a filter for actual game winners but changing it to takes dwayne wade from fga to fga for me cant see the whole list since not subscribed to iti still imagine lebron and kobe are at the top but would be curious what it looks likedirk with a cool sheeshonly caveat is this only goes back to so youre only getting jordans last years on the bullslebron not only having attempts but sitting at is nutspeople who didnt watch that game always go to the shooting they didnt see him hustle for huge boards and make clutch free throws in the q he had a bad game with his shot not hitting and he still willed them to win also sasha the machine vujacic deserves a mentionkobe is the rudy gay of basketballthis mf was the scariest player to watch when he plays against your team the amount of daggers ive seen this dude hit is insanelmao yall had blinders on he shot less than on ho ahead or game tying shots at the end of gamesworse than bron yall remember the he hit but ignore the missesedit lmaoguys brought proof below me in comments but im downvoted this much kobe is trash in clutch moments efg of all time terrible kobe stans are in denial he was a rapist and world is better hes deadyou havent watch curry playkobe shot like in last possession scenarios for his careerfrom including playoffs seconds or less left in the game his team with the ball either tied or down by to points kobe took game winning shots he made of them for a round league average in that span was his fg in the clutch last five minutes game within points was which was basically his career fghe came of nowhere like that derek jeter flip playthats the thing though if hes triple teamed and still dangerous the odds of the offensive rebound and putback dunk are up significantly as evidenced in the videothe one against the kings where he steps into that two footed plant is as pure as a game winning shot as you can get just poetrythats because kobe killed their team for years and theyre still bitter about itreddit sjws mani cant post anything about anything without hearing about itim a kobe fan he has earned his praise and he earned the colorado comments as wellhey buddy if i posted highlights of karl malone should everyone only talk about ball do you think thats realisticwhy shouldnt we its best to remind people this dude is a rapist so they dont go blindly worshipping him and downplaying the victims strugglesand hed most likely miss and youd lose whoopde doo you wanna die igrnba is addicted to virtue signaling to stroke their own ego and dunking on a dead man is as easy as it getspeople hate kobe so much that i saw a thread in nbatalk where people put duncan in the top all time and kobe outside the top based on what hardwarehes nowhere near top thats disrespectful to other playerswhat are you on about today players run through moving screens to get the ball in the back courti guess curry doesnt exist these days huh than curry kd wband on that kind of coverage and volumeoff the charts shot difficulty he took drive and all were jumpshots a tabulation of the shots he took at the end of the videothey were all from the seasonit only tallys kobes attempts not putbacks by other playershe shoots in the video loland who would you rather have on that roster taking them fisher bynum gasol brown youd be fired immediately from your coaching position if those were your picksso the data for people to see pulled from this site that was comparing a whole bunch of peeps final sec playoffs since playerfgfgafgpmpapastdastdkobelebronwade final minute playoffs since playerfgfgafgpmpapastdastdkobelebronwadeclutch playoffs since playerfgfgafgpmpapastdastdkobelebronwade sites data is only to from my rough memory lebron became even more clutch with his shooting since then this is also a fair stopping point for kobe especially in regards to playoff statistics someone else should find a way to list the data tracked by the nba which i think became better since around most game winners btw on the most toughest shots rings ernehtriple teamed and impossible shots though this shit was insane and way more contact was allowedlebron went btwmuch easier shots less difficulty less coverage less shots takendo you want lebron james taking the last shot nba basketball dude that won five ringsfor reference kobe shot fga on game tyingwinning shots here are the others you mentionedsteph fgabrunson fga and lillard fga both ray allen fgasource none of them are going to shoot over people and none of them warrants that many defenders ignoring the fact that defense is very lax compared to kobes erastill won ringsgm survey had kobe as the clutchest player for years straight and nephews on reddit want to discredit cause they hate the man lmaolebrons percentages on such shots are way better than kobeswell the stats say lebron is a better clutch player better shooting percentage better overall outcomes because hes more willing to pass to the open manits okay to disagree with that since stats dont tell the whole story and eye test might say something different to you but its not like your friend has no argumentlakers fans showing no respect for the man who brought them their latest championship smhi have very low confidence in lebrons clutch shooting in the regular season in the playoffs i always expect it to go inthis seven game winners he took was the difference from st seed to eight seedon a low scoring defense heavy game had boardspierce went of allen went of ok edgelord were rebounded and they scored anyway at least partially because he was double teamed or demanding attention from multiple defendersthis is why anyone saying kobe is not clutch is a joke some of those shots is literally his teammates throwing the ball in his hands with seconds left in the game and hes still taking them he literally bailed out his team so many times because no one else wanted to the pressureabout half of those would be a foul in todays nba especially the shots behind the pt lineunless your name is tyrese haliburton this seasonas a lifelong celtics fan and unapologetic kobe hater i think this is actually more clutch than someone could realistically hope for and it causes me great pain to say soits either going in or its notkobe was most clutch when up points if the lakers were up with left you felt pretty safei honestly could care less because tim duncan is a completely better playerthat turnaround trapped in the corner vs the blazers is the most insane shot ive have seen anyone make and no one else was shooting that except kobe lolid say he was the best tough jump shot maker in nba historyas a laker fan first and foremost i think thats the most frustrating thing while he can make these incredible shots he didnt have to take them hes so talented and could have made it easier on himself he just loved hero ballpass get the reboundaka kobe assisthonestly thats not even the case for at least of these the defense is literally just ball watching while gasol man powers his way under the basket and defenders on the enemy team are legitimately flat footed ball watching after the shot is taken not even a diss to kobe but what the fuck is the defense doing half the time actual offensive threats lolexcept ais second option was eric snow lmaomost championship teams have length height and defensetheres also a reason why everyone is fixed on him teammates and opponents both trusted kobe to make a wicked shoteastern conference you forgot okc with wins as wellspurs get an an extra l confirmed spurs hater lolnot taking no for an answer fun fact mamba mentality was a pr spin to distract from the colorado incidentlol tatum aint kobe despite his wishesaaaaaaand im sad againrip in pieces haliban jan june this is stupid hes been consistently good for like years now other than occasional dips from injurydeath ray pointed at the planetnot really lebron is getting to the rim more than any of these guysceltics dont get enough credit for how good they played defensively in that game it took a while for the lakers to start breaking throughand he couldve missed more still want the ball in his hand as a fan and out of it as an opponent youre out of touch with the game buddy how often does the best shooter end up taking the shot not often at all if youre ending a game with duncan robinson max struss malik beasley taking your game winners youre probably also hoping your set doesnt fall apart the guy taking your last shot is usually going to be the guy whos not gonna let the moment rattle him and is willing to create his own with very limited timebron is one of the top players of all time and is incredibly clutch im not sure what the average percentage on game tyingwinning shots is however most people knew kobe was going to shoot it the fact he got as high a percentage as he did in the most clutch moments against the most defensive coverage since he shot over double teams and was clearly getting the last shot every time is whats impressive plus having the courage to take the shot time and time againdid you read the first part of my comment idgaf if he went all game i still dont want the ball on his hand in the last possessionremovedits not the same and not even close sound insufferable get those online forum points tho famcan you elaborate on the league average being yeah everyone remembers the ones he made and forgets all the ones he missed he was obviously a great clutch player but his biggest issue was that he always had to take that last shot even if it wasnt the right play he would attempt a fade away while triple teamed rather than hit his guy for a wide open corner three and even for a great player like him those insanely tough contested shots werent a consistent recipe for successbut the counterpoint to that is he was never afraid of the moment and if you did give him an open look more often than not he would nail it looking at kobes entire career he was great and won a lot so its hard to really fault him for much but i always think he couldve been even greater had he been less of a to put it bluntly ball hogok sure but against memphis halfway through video thats awful tons of time and open dudesthe victim that got a lifetimes worth of money from accusing the guythere is a difference between being accused of rape and being a rapist the district attorney dropped the case against kobe because they didnt have enough to go to trial and the dna evidence was tenuous at best stop itblindly worshipping victims struggles you like using silly phrases silly personthats what im saying kobe gets the ball in the backcourt court with no defense with seconds left in these clips steph or lebron or kd would need screens and a dribble handoff to even have a chance defense is much better nowahhh duh i was kinda skim watching it and totally missed that it was a putbackand to be fair some of those looks were absolutely terrible doesnt matter who was shooting them they were extremely low quality catch and shoot playsso overall he has a terrible fg despite his good performance in i didnt see in the title to be fair but im talking overallyeah in a good year but it wasnt like that always and some of those are really bad shotson that roster id want kobe of coursereally appreciate you going through the effort do to this i knew i was correct i just couldnt source where i got it fromnow tell me his overall on shots to tie or win throughout his career i believe its sub raped a women ernehim still taking the guy with zero rape chargesisnt it a joy to be able to use stats to prove a point including my own fallacy of picking a shooter without doing the researchi did not realize steph was so bad at clutch shooting just like others in this thread we assume a player will be good at the end of games because their reputation proceeds themthe greatest shooter of all time doesnt warrant defenders defenders came out on kobe because they knew he wasnt going to pass not because he needed defenders on himwell while it varies case by case but over a big sample size you shouldnt really be shooting over players should you i love kobe as a player but lets not idolize him as if selfishness is a good basketball qualityi mean they sent that many defenders cause they knew he was going to take the shot anyway and it workedyes he won championships that doesnt mean i wasnt him shooting the last shot robert horry was more clutch he has rings kobe was still the better player doesnt make him the person you want shooting the last shotnobody is immune to bias kobe is my second favorite player alltime behind dirk but he was objectively worse in the clutch than a lot of other stars he just had a ton of volume and people in general remember makes more than misseslol kobe gave us sorry but lebron we appreciate you but we will never love you like we love kobe manin other words kobe shot worse than pierce and allen combinedand in the bucks and grizzlies games he missed one shot but ended up hitting the winning shot lateri used to call those hockey assists he would draw the defenders out so one his guys could get to the rim and scoop up the reboundthats the shit i was gonna say some of those misses resulted in easy put backsthis was the most surprising thing to me how often someone else got the rebound after a miss or when he missed it was tied and they won in ot seemed like they won every gameand most of his team benefitted from that kind of pressure release those laker teams did not have the same level of on ball playmaking volume as we see from elite offenses and costars pau was assisted on of his shots during the championship runs for ppg i was just looking at random teams the lakers played to find a comparison and mehmet okur in was assisted on his career percent was and not saying okur was the creator pau was pau was a better passer created more pressure in the post still scored more but just that his volume wasnt especially high lamar could be a ball handler and creator but not at a very high volume and the knock on lamar was always consistency ariza meta fisher and a young and often injured bynum are the other starters and primary minute getters during those runs there was a lot of times where action just wasnt happening and kobe ends up as the release valve in those circumstances and it led to two years of elite offenses that held up well in the playoffs including bumping back up to a playoff offensive rating points higher than their regular season in that dynamic shows its head again in the clutch if you have seconds or whatever left on an inbound should you try to run a pin down for fisher or dump it in to pau and see if he can beat his man from wherever you can get an entry pass to in that time i dont think the lakers were constructed to force shots that are resilient to defensive attention fgts is one thing including in the clutch but how it fits into your teams offense speaks more to your impact and importance imofrankly this is why its so important to put stats in context kobe only shot from the field but anyone who actually watched him knows that a ton of those shots were bail out shots that he would just need to jack up when his team couldnt find a shot and the shot clock was running down even without those kobe would never have been as efficient as mj or lebron due to his style of play being inherently less efficient fg wise he operated from further out than either mj or lebron but he was also much much more efficient than his from the field impliednaw he was best when we were down on lakers forumssubs and circles we all felt like a win was coming as long as we were within points with minutes left obviously not as crazy a thought nowadays but back in the dead ball era that was a crazy end game comebackwe called it kobe rangei think thats what makes kobe such a permanent subject of debate he was probably the best difficult shot maker in nba history but because of that ability and his mentality he settled for so many bad shotsparticularly with shaq as a teammate a lot of his tough shots shouldve been passes but if he wasnt taking those ridiculous shots from age maybe he wouldnt have been as incredible carrying the lakers from and delivering the two nonshaq titlesu ever see the one against patty mills at the top of the keythis may be the first meme capitalized white text with black border i can recall seeing personally or maybe so easy a kaman could do it lol simpler timesgasol was a way better offensive player than anyone on that sixers squad other than aithat team was on par with lebrons st cavs finals team for worst team to make a finalsstubby short and porous is how i personally prefer to build my teamsnot like lal with gasol odom and bynum even artest built for kobe to go and rebound does this help buddykobe never played for the celticswest wins gets you seedeast wins gets you home courtyou mean the leastern conference usually top heavy and then the rest of the teams basically from the th seed and beyond were mid to flat out terrible teams lolthat i didhaha i swear it was a typo he really sacrificed his body for the causethe most wild thing out there is if you polled rnba who the most overrated was it wouldnt have been him but he was most overrated by nba players and just said neat check this out i thought you were talking about jeremy lin and was like uhhhh did i miss something because i thought he was overseas for the last yearswe were talking about game winners in dont care about past yearsthey lost winning gets you the creditand he couldve missed more still want the ball in his hand as a fan and out of it as an opponentnopehe shot efg of in clutch moments proof posted by someone else below me he was trash opponents always wanted him taking dumbass contested shots and choking as usualthe guy taking your last shot is usually going to be the guy whos not gonna let the moment rattle him but it did rattle himbecause he was terrible in clutch momentshowever most people knew kobe was going to shoot it the fact he got as high a percentage as he didbrohe shot efg how can that be any worse at what point can you acknowledge someone is not good in those momentsmaybe you didnt read my commenteverything you said was false he was terrible at the end of games the opposite of clutch the guy was ass in the clutchhes correct thoughkobe stans hate factsefg in final seconds when going for tie or lead shots all time terrible chokeryeah he shot not sure what youre proving hereyes providing stats that show kobe was a mediocre clutch time scorer at best makes me insufferable he is far from automatic in the clutch as the person i replied to statedhow would i elaborate from to including the playoffs whenever a player took a shot tied or down points with less than seconds left in q or ot the average conversion rate across the league was kobe never made the right play alright he never hit his guy for a wide open three in that same stat from he had shots but only assistnot a flawless strategy but the risk was worth building around to win chipsthe same victim that bragged to her friends about having sex with kobe and had sex with another dude hours later per the forensic evidencein the words of dave chappelle this bitch got noahs ark in her pantiesthe following day bryant issued a statement apologizing to faber and her family for the pain they had endured through the months of the case he again asserted that in the moment he had believed the encounter was consensual but stated that he had come to understand that faber had not viewed it that wayprosecutors seemed to have a strong case according to court documents an examination of the woman at a hospital revealed a bruise on her neck and tears in her vaginal wall both her underwear and bryants shirt were bloody bryant told the police he had not explicitly asked for consentthe case was dropped because the accuser was unwilling to testify which isnt uncommon at all when it comes to sexual assault just say you dont care that he raped someone because he won yall some championships rather than resorting to whatever tf that isyeah you got some hater goggles on most if not all of these shots came off of screens or dribble handoff from pau gasol point one clip where kobe was open getting free from a hugging defender doesnt count all of those players you mention get the same looksremovedcould care less tbh i want him shooting that shot everytime if a player cares about his shooting in that situation thats a red flagno proper arguments left huh ernehraped whom erneh no rapist foundtil thar can effect shooting the dude that made the toughest shots in nba history shockingwell while it varies case by case but over a big sample size you shouldnt really be shooting over players should you i love kobe as a player but lets not idolize him as if selfishness is a good basketball qualitythis clip is an effective way of showing why he played winning basketballhe attracts double triple teams that offensive rebounding is much easiersee how many times they win with a put back in this clip someone is downvoting when he did play winning basketball lmao finals in seasons winning shaq gave you kobe gave you yeah because theres multiple threats in boston and theres only kobe on the other side that they need to swarmkobe still averaged on that series despite that game thrilleris this some kinda gotcha momentin the exact same spot he missed toothey called it kobe assists in basketballthats just not what a hockey assist is its the pass to the passer who receives the assist the misinformation these days smdh you mean the kobe assistthats funny in hockey when someone draws out the defender so one of his guys can get to the net and scoop up the rebound we call those kobe assists i mean they are genuine assists in hockey but we call them kobe assiststruly innovative stuffyep i believe lowe tried tracking kobe assists back then and surprise surprise kobe had far more kobe assists than anyone else despite the criticism for always taking shots while triple teamed long triple teamed shots means easy rebounds for putbacks it was as much of a style choice as guys like brook lopez not getting a lot of rebounds because hes focusing on boxing out which makes his own numbers look worse but his team better its one of the things that box score watchers who underrate kobe never seem to getthose guys were definitely taking those kinds of shots though kobe is an alltimer but he had a habit of forcing the issue more than lebron or mj would thats why his efficiency is worse if he wasnt taking those ridiculous shots from age if he wasnt taking those shots no one else was that team wasnt as loaded as people make it seem to be they didnt even have a secondary player who can make a shot of his own in the th when shaq is getting hackedkobe im freeand it was probably worse tbh nets thofat drunk and stupid is no way to go through life sonim not your buddy friendits really been the same story for the last yearsfreudian typo love it go lake showsure but its a bit foolish to pretend their defense wasnt incredible that gamewhere did you get that number also whats league averagehes the best tough shot maker in nba history hes got the best shooting percentage among superstars on game winninggame tying shots in playoff history hes also the best tough shot maker in nba historyand its not close youre blatantly lying to get your kobe hate off go pick dirk and lose if you want to leave us sensible folks alonelol nephew what grade are you in and did you even watch this videoagain ill keep repeating it i dont give a flying fuck about analytics when it comes to kobeposts like this really goes to show people do not understand basketball is more than a numbers gamenot going to convince this dude hes not willing to look at stats just basing it on emotioncurry westbrook durant they all took less and made less on easier looksthey must be suckers of all suckers thena few thingswhy not that league average isnt a useful datapoint but volume per player matters how many players with decent volume shot over that percentage where does kobe rank in that listshe also tried to do the same thing with eminem and she also admitted to the court that she lied about certain thingsim definitely not trying to hate im saying the three pointer changed how these possessions are defendedfrom left to left are what i mean the first play he gets a wide open inbound in the back court with seconds left today they would have guarded that super tight to make the pass difficult and make getting a shot harderthe next play he comes all the way down the court with less than seconds left and only gets guarded once he hits the three point line in other clips people guard better but those two stick out to menone of that changes the fact that he shot on these with an extremely high degree of difficulty thats insane but the thunder or the wolves are guarding these plays from the inbound not letting him walk up the courtok bud theres like clips in there where hes barely guarded or got a good step on the defender not getting the ball with his back to the basket with less than a second on the clock ill forgive your room temperature iq though im sure daily life puts you through the ringer enoughi mean id rather have about players before himdamn you got me unymphobbcqueenthen why did he apologize for raping that woman heads would recall they referred to allen iverson getting hockey assists as early as his mvp seasonthat is also a hockey assist but shooting and your team getting the rebound and scoring is also a hockey assist do you even watch hockeyits a weird analogy to hockey because the passes always count as long as possession doesnt change in hockey a rebounded shot recovered by the offense without the defense controlling the puck would be considered a pass for the purposes of scoring assistsit is what is scored as an assist in hockey but its not how its typically used in these discussionsive never heard anyone call it a kobe assist in the us might be a canadian thingits an entire strategy in hockey lol just get some big boys parked down by the net and get the puck on goal let the big guys whack at the goalie and hope for the bestit definitely worked for that lakers team because the rebounding talent on that roster was insane gasol bynum odom and artest three guys and artest crashing the paint definitely a team built around letting kobe chuckthe finals was basically won by the lakers offensive rebounds after kobes missed shots its both a knock against him that he missed so many shots but counts for him because the offense for both teams in that series was dreadful and he was the only real perimeter shot creator on the lakersit worked because of the certainty that kobe will take the shot defense always commits and his teammates always go to find a good rebounding position its sort of like a steph gravity situation but instead of his teammates positioning for open s they position for the reboundputback insteadneither lebron nor mj were taking those types of shots at the same volume kobe was this isnt a kobe is just as good as them he just took worse shots thing either both mj and lebron are better all time than kobe and while yes kobe did have a habit of forcing the issue this wasnt really as bad or as common as people made it out to be a wide majority of his bad shots were taken as bail out shots and that was primarily since it was built into the lakers gameplan kobe is the greatest tough shot maker of all time and was capable of hitting nearly every possible shot at an at least aboveaverage clip which meant the lakers particularly postshaq during their run actively took advantage of that fact by allowing the offense to run through pau on one side of the court to try and get everyone involved which was crucial for building confidence for the role players to go on those deep runs and then they would just flip it to kobe who was isolated on the other side of the court of they couldnt get a good shot with the shot clock already winding down lebron teams generally worked in the inverse like all heliocentric offenses outside of miami and his current lakers teamjust because rick fox grant horry and fisher werent elite iso players its not like like they were scrubs lol you dont need a bunch of iso guys in a teamit wasnt they had dpoy in dikembe sixth man of the year in aaron mckie and larry brown as coach over mike brownyeah they shut down one of the best scorers in the world but he still won the game in other facets of the game we remember kobe for things like that if the cs win then their defense gets much more credit hes got the best shooting percentage among superstars on game winninggame tying shots in playoff history youre blatantly lying to get your kobe hate off most gametying or leadtaking shots with under seconds left in the game in the playoffs since whose lyingedit spoiler he was indeed misinformedthis video is horseshit and cherry picked yall gullible af proof already been posted numerous times in this thread kobe shot efg percent in the final seconds to go ahead or tie he was trash all time bad nephew my sons older than you analytics and just shots madeshots attempted lol what an absolute moronyou said hes clutch facts dont lie blinders on kobe was a choker more often than not please explain how shooting in go ahead or tying situations can ever be ok simply because you remember the rare times he actually made it just because you forgot all his airballs and bricks when it mattered doesnt mean it didnt happenstats and numbers dont tell the whole story if that was the case just simulate the games and dont even bother having human players play the game lmao you reddit analytics nerds are something else go watch an actual game in personnone of those guys have the reputation that kobe has the guy i replied to said kobe was automatic in the clutch which is verifiably false using your own provided data to was the range i found that had been analyzed by a statistician heres every shot that was a game winner or tie in the last since the season as you can see kobe does have a lot of attempts but a pretty middling success rateokay you two thats enough apologize and shake handsplease humor me with your list of about players youd rather have taking the final shotganewinners are usually the toughest shots in the game due to the urgency kobe is the best tough shot maker in history its really that simpleacceptance is the first step proud of youlaw speakpart of the settlementthank yoummmm like in the s because some kobe hater made some article about kobes teammates getting a lot of these type of points because of kobelol it got a bunch of upvotes the misinformation these dayshi just to add to the discussion im from latin america and have seen snow twice in my life i only knew the pass to the passer type of hockey assist from basketball forums and podcasts the one that you say never heard of it so theres thati am canadian and i have never heard kobe assist used in hockey ever i also dont consider a shot off the rim a hockey assist in basketball in sports without secondary assists hockey assist is typically the pass to the assisting passyeah ilgauskas and mo williams were pretty good all stars even but dpoy and th man are superior not even close in terms of coachingedit my bad mo wasnt in that lineup still just confirming that ais team was betteri dont disagree im a lakers fan myself and the lakers also played incredible defensekobe haters love to talk about and not the rebounds or ray allen or ppunless my source is just capnot meyoure talking about career but this video is specifically about or are you saying this video isnt every shot kobe took at the end of a close game between also did you watch any of these games live or any of kobes career live looking at stats alone and not actually watching the games and feeling those feelings in the moment misses a ton of informationlmfao you acting like nba players have a good shooting in the clutch you realize that most of the numbers in the clutch look poor amongst all the greats rightlebron do you want lebron james taking the last shot nba basketball youtube durant how clutch was playoff kevin durant nba basketball dirkdo you want old man dirk nowitzki taking the last shot nba basketball youre looking at the results of all his attempts which does not equal his chance of making any one particular shot in the moment its a nobrainer to say you as an opposition fan dont want the ball in his hands teams gameplanned to deny him the ball specifically and youd be laughed out of the room for suggesting ackshually let him have the ball and take it his efg is a true illustration of how stats really can be misused by people who dont understand them but go offlet me get this straight truth doesnt matter because it doesnt tell the entire storyi give you a bag of coins it has measurements such as weight value and mass all of those are stats at the end of a players career you can look back and use their statistics to tell you the probability of an outcome the idea that you can ignore them to substitute your belief is ludicrous kobe was a winner but he wasnt a great clutch shooter just like mj was a great scorer but for most of his career you didnt want him shooting s a lot of his misses came after his achilles tear his averages gets swayed by those shots he took where theres only under a second left literally catch and shoot mostly off balance with multiple defenders on him most stars wouldnt even take that shot actually the fact that he is shooting against people isnt even going to show on the stat sheetappreciate the linkill give you jokicluka curry lillardbird jordan duh lebron magic jerry westiguadalanashim not debating someone with your namewhy take a settlement if you didnt rape them thenis it the hero worship of an athlete or a general disdain for women that makes yall so delusionalyup putting the puck on net for a rebound is an assist if a defender or a goalie takes possession of the puck then it is no longer an assist if the offensive player is able to take possession back and then scoregenerally its going to be a shot off the pads i dont know if the post would count i am canadian and i have never heard kobe assist used in hockey everthat surprises me im in western canada maybe it never caught on out east also how old are you when i played competitively kobe was still in the nba so maybe its fallen out of favour but i was playing city rec last year and we had a rebound that went right onto a guys stick he scored and everyone went kobe so maybe its just not something younger guys are doingmo williams wasnt on the squad but one brown equals another brown as they say those teams were actually very similar in a lot of waysmo wasnt on that team his second option was supposed to be larry hughes who shot from the field during that playoff runcavs had the fourth best defense in the league and actual shooters for pass outs this was not the case for ais teammo williams was only ever an all star because of lebron and he wasnt even on that team ilgauskas was solid but on the downswing at that pointthat game was a rock fight nobody was hitting anything pure grit won that gamethe source is like years oldit is because the site was last updated in edit also the definition is different yours is extended to secondsif you want current as of end of kobes playoff career final sec playoffs since playerfgfgafgpmpapastdastdkobelebronwadelebrons clutch stats from years since arent shown here and he has notably gotten better at clutch shooting since then edit changed to this comment chain wasnt about the video reading is hard huhand yet kobe is worse than all of them even lebron is above youre picking individual years heres near careers worth of data most gametying or leadtaking shots with under seconds left in the game in the playoffs since final sec playoffs since playerfgfgafgpmpapastdastdkobelebronwade final minute playoffs since playerfgfgafgpmpapastdastdkobelebronwadeclutch playoffs since playerfgfgafgpmpapastdastdkobelebronwade tables data till lebron also became a better clutch shooter after this obviously nobody with a brain ever said lebron was a clutch shooter at the end of gameshes one of the worst for all time greats yet still better than kobe cherry picking a single year for kd next using dirks worst yearseven acknowledging it was when he was and retiringis definitely one of the dumbest takes everthanks for proving my pointkobe is so bad you have to compare him to a known bad clutch shooter still better than kobe a cherry picked year from kd and a retiring dirkand still come out with kobe looking worse you can say that all you wantplayers have gone on record multiple times about how they loved when he took those shotsbecause his efg was garbage his ego was too big to pass so just let him get the ballthen double himhe will shoot with hands in his face and miss almost every time some neckbeard on reddit remembering the rare times he made them doesnt change anythinglmfao youre comparing sports to a bag of coins thats a great analogy bro and the truth isnt all in numbers eye test is a real thing too you also have to realize basketball is a rhythm sport lot of these guys are streaky so when theyre off theyre really off and vice versa that can fuck with the numbers the s and era of basetball was also vastly different than the analytics era of today players back then relied on superstar hero ball so most of the stars back then didnt have great efficient minus lebron the data i submitted above from was before his achilles tear i dont understand your assertion that most stars wouldnt take that shot you think guys are passing up game winningtying shots with under a second left the reason he had to shoot over or guys was because he refused to pass in those situationsi also see weve moved on from kobe was automatic in the clutch to making excuses for why he wasnt automatic in the clutchlmaothats not even close to about thought as much you dont have any arguments even if you wanted to debate me its a convenient excuse little manstill not in the acceptance stage it seemshave you never heard of a nofault settlementpeople and corporations settle while admitting no fault all the timeyou settle civil claims often because the cost of litigation can be expensive time consuming and ultimately not worth it at all this isnt the gotcha that a lot of you think it is it just shows you dont really know a lot about the legal system innocent people and entities settle all the time hes losing hundreds of millions from deals sponsors etc its just a statement that he probably didnt care about why would he hell eventually win the case due to lack of evidence of the accuser but at what costim a goalie trust me when i know how it works in hockey post counts too just in basketball i wouldnt consider that a hockey assist even in hockey most the credit is given to the guy that gets the rebound and puts it in no one is going to say it was an amazing assist they might say its a smart play but thats about itlike you cant control the outcome enough for it the be a result of the shooters skill if that makes sensemaybe im in ontario and am only in my twenties i play with varied age range though there doesnt seem to be a lot of overlap in basketball and hockey fans in ottawa though i could see it being a thing in toronto or somethinglmaoo google failed me gotta fact check betterno further questions your honor last updated in is hilariousi must say youre reallynot nice resulting to childish insults aside this chain is of course about the video people here are talking about how scary it felt when kobe had the ball in his hands at the end of games and this video has some examples of why even when kobe missed the team often still scored because the opposing team often felt the same way and were just doing anything they could to stop kobe and borderline ignored the rest of the team you also didnt answer any of my questions are you saying this video doesnt show all the late game shots that kobe took between did you watch any of these games live and what grade are you in lebron takes most of his shots when the game is tied when there is no pressurehell pass it more times than shoot it if theyre down a point or two nobody is getting defended like kobe he takes a lot more shots defense gets lax as the years go on to allow shooters more spacethis is what defense on lebrons look like in do you want lebron james taking the last shot nba basketball youtube fans lost their brain when they lost doncic it seemsi realize im talking to an idiot so ill try to make this simple and then move on the truth is all about numbers whos the best point shooter of all time try to justify that without using psince were ignoring numbers and stats we can claim anything because we dont have any referencereminder that youre not talking about a player still in his career who can make a turn for the better but a player whos already done and retired which means his stats are complete and not subject to changeyouve made your decision and are not interested in being persuaded but the idea that you can use feelings to supersede what the stats tell you is what makes you fanaticalyou seriously expect me to sit here and type out namesi just have dignity something you lack if that was true please cite these hundreds of millions worth of deals he lost then he would lose even more from effectively admitting defeat in the case its a pretty fucking black mark on your record to effectively lose a rape case if you could simply make up a rape case to get millions of dollars from any athlete you like it would happen a lot more there was legs to it and everyone knows itright its a smart play im not sure what youre arguing here are you saying that if you can draw multiple defenders and let your bigs get under the rim its a bad play in basketball but not in hockey whats your argument heremight be an age thing then which kind of makes sensethis chain is of course about the videostill cant read the top comment of this chain has nothing to do woth this specific video it was a generic comment about kobes clutch abilitythis isnt necessarily true he also takes higher percentage shots ie going to the basket or taking a footer kobe is taking the best look he has lol all those players have faced defensively focused schemes made to stop or enable them for one reason or another some players are just more athletically gifted skilled or have better bbiq to be able to get a better shot he definitely has volume the tables data was until i dont know if you missed that its fair to say lebron played in the same era as peak kobe considering how amazing lebron was as a young player edit took out my last sentence kobe stans hate facts love anal rapistsbut hate factswilt chamberlain is the greatest player of all time numbers dont lie your comment made it seem like you had names locked and loaded its ok if you were exaggerating and realized theres not actually that many players youd choosedignity huh yeah right thats why you downvote my post a literal second after i replied to you cute how tough you act completely unbotheredbryant lost an estimated million in sponsorships as a result of the legal sagaconsidering kobe amassed more than a billion during his career which he would have not if he didnt settle the case immediately its a no brainerkobe bryant sexual assault case explained revisiting the allegations and why charges were dropped sporting newsthen he would lose even more from effectively admitting defeat in the casethats the thing he didnt lose the case was dropped and he made a resurgence as the face of the nbaits a pretty fucking black mark on your record to effectively lose a rape caseagain he didnt lose the casewhy are you guys even repeating this lmaosimply make up a rape case to get millions of dollars from any athletemany attempts were already made d rose was accused a decade ago alsoexfriend laie weatherwax admits she never believed faber was the victim of a rape attack because the blonde had a longtime plan to trick a celebrity into bed and then force him to pay upin an exclusive interview with americas the globe weatherwax who had agreed to testify for the defence before the case was dismissed says kobes a good looking guy and he has a fat walletin my opinion at least per cent of her faber attraction to him was simply because hes famous shes always wanted to be famousmy friend and i liked eminem but katelyn took it to the extreme she was obsessed with him and felt compelled to go meet him to try for sexweatherwax claims faber even plotted to lure eminem to bed when he was scheduled to play a new years eve show in vail colorado months after the kobe bryant scandal explodedshe adds she called a friend at his eminem hotel found out what room he was in and where hed sing there was a plan to lure him into his room the pool or hot tub to be in position to scoreweatherwax also claims her old pal once had sex with one boy because he looked likejustin timberlakefabers attorney lin wood insists weatherwax is just a troubled lady whos been seeking her minutes of fame expal reveals kobes accuser plotted to lure eminem into bed contactmusiccom im just saying im not calling it a hockey assist in basketball to miss a shot as its barely called an assist in hockey it just is because of how the rules work in the sport in basketball a hockey assist is to pass to the assisting passer not brick a shot and hope your team gets it but thats my opinioni mean people my age still say kobe throwing things into trash bins so thats still around at least cmon now i bet you can answer at least one question how about this if you want to pass the th grade you have to answer at least one of these questionsthats truebut this is also truelebron takes most of his shots when the game is tiedhellkobe bryant cant believe lebron passed up final shot twice allstar game know what the craziest thing is you can use other stats to argue that point i realize this is an insane concept for youi reiterate you are being completely disingenious if you think someone is going to sit here and list off names if i had the time or the desire i definitely could do you disagree with any name i actually listedyour nameim not reading past this first point you said hundreds of millions which is vastly different to millionthey are stupid questions irrelevant to the conversation you butted into yesthis video shows how great kobe was for a single run never said he wasnt great for one run if you make the same highlight video of every single other year combinedhe shoots less than efg pathetic huhtyping names would only take a couple minutes im sure youll have stats to tell me im wrong but i wouldnt take iguodala nash or jokicobviously its a situation well never see but it would be cool to see how all these players perform in tje exact same lastshot scenario like the only variable is changing the player i dont think many players could replicate the in this video taking the exact same shotsyour argumentspedanticwhat i mean is if he continues to lose sponsors investment hed lose hundreds of millions of dollarshe earned million that year aloneyoure looking at a hundred million earned wealth in like years hes not getting any of that if he didnt settleyou answered a stupid irrelevant question nice you get to pass the th grade maybe youre not so not nice after all good luck in th gradeiggy was an obvious joke nash is one of the most efficient nba guards in history jokic has proven countless times that he delivers in the clutch sure lakers and warriors fans would agreeagain im speaking in general this was a very impressive season for kobelmao so cringey acting like youre super nice and pleasant with your passive aggressive bullshit at least i admit it pathetic to pretend youre differentsorry for the cringe us older folks can be like that how old are your kids again and im not pretending to be nice howd you come to that assumption i may not go out of my way to shout out insults like a douche bag hiding behind a keyboard but im also not going to pretend to be nice to a douche bag hahajesus dudecalling someone out for being a meanie pants while being a passive aggressive jerk yourself is ironic why do you want to know my sons age hes in high school and definitely more cringe than you so you got that going for youdont worry itll be oktake care kidyou too pal',\n",

       " 'i cant wait to see what cam has to say to zach calling him a th or th manteams not really trying to pay top dollar for guys who only get buckets and nothing else gotta add to your game or be willing to accept a th man role like jamal crawford or lou williamsjordan clarkson type guythis is one soundbite from a very long segment about cam thomas but zach lowe is right in his cam assessment the nets dont even like cam thomasif this was stephen a wed have had already listened to endless rants and tiradesdont aggregate my king without full contextzach carries himself well here particularly in comparison to how lots of other nba media would have handled thisi mean he averaged and cant even get million a year you are what your market says you aresmall sgs who have to dominate the ball to be effective are not attractive to teams trying to win especially if you suck on defense the ideal sg these days is prime klay thompson a player that can catch and shoot play defense and be effective with minimum dribbles kobe and d wade are the last ball dominate sgs that won a rings but kobe wasnt small and both were on all defense teamspayton pritchard with an ego except he cant defendzach also mentioned the or so minutes he talked about all facets of thomas game praising him multiple times both the initial quote and now this quote are missing almost all the contextin shocking news zach lowe is smarter than cam thomaswhat is this month long arc of lowe and thomas lmaodamn he doubled down and said he was trash nicelywe are talking like a y has absolutely no room for improvementawesome response from zach calm measured and reasonable hope cam thomas hears thiscam thomas def improved as a passer kinda hard to say he cant acquiesce to a superior offensive talent when there wasnt one on that brooklyn teamcj mccollum flirting cam thomas harassmentnot sure why weve had a couple clips from this fourdayold episode posted todayhavent seen if the bucks are linked to cam but thats the team i feel like hed help the most if they even have anything to offer the nets for him id like to see him pry the ball from giannis in crunch time but hed help their bench scoring immenselycam thomas is a walking bucket but i would have to agree hes style is that he needs to have the ball obviously but hes not well rounded enough for a team to build around him as a or so pretty much u have to try and be a two way guy or be the lou will off the bench the only player i can think of recently that has a similar build is donovan mitchell but he gets away cuz of his wingspan and athleticismi mean its true if he cant accept being like or as good and say lou will at that then wtf lolim a lifelong nets fan and hes not wrongits sorta like realizing your niche isnt selling yachts or eight figure software contracts some people are best at selling smb bb saas and thats okthis back and forth between these is corny imoth or th man zach give it up my guycam thomas response to zach lowe is part of the reason he doesnt have a contract right now zach lowe isnt the reason why he hasnt got a contract bit he lashed out on him at a time when he shouldnt teams dont like guys who cant take criticism and arent self aware about there game i know he sees guys like tyler herro get payed and he wants that but he isnt those guys and those guys are more adaptable in a team situation as playmakers and are more self aware of their gameseh i think thats a little harshi definitely agree with zach lowe here people see guys like cam thomas and immediately make a bunch of accusations and judgments about them as a player as if its his fault he plays for a shitty brooklyn nets team we know cam thomas is an elite scorer but just because he hogs the ball on the horrendous team he was drafted into doesnt mean hes not capable of taking a lesser role again as if he hasnt already done that for half of his career so farthese types of players on bad teams that score and dont play any defense never take any accountability and complain constantly really need a reality checkmoronic takewhy do people like zach lowe even have a platformmaybe something about lowe getting waived from espni mean if you look at a team like okc where would he fit he would be best off the bench on a great team and running the show on a win teama great team has a guy like caruso first off the bench a bad team has cam scoring per game with the ball in his hands a lot cam probably thinks hes a top playerprobably says that he is the first guy as long as you exclude the five guys in front of himi still dont know the difference between cam thomas and cam johnson and at this point im afraid to askthe thing is guys like lou will and crawford were genuinely good playmakers as well they were always scorefirst but they were pretty great passers on top of being elite offball players that could compliment other stars cam thomas had one of the highest usage rates and scores at a good rate but his playmaking is below average his offball work is pretty poor so he kinda has to be number guy on a team as he is right now and thats not what crawford lou will were likealso guys like crawford were getting paid th or th highest on the team thomas is looking for a contract that would put him in the top or higher on most teams also the aprons add a lot of restrictionstwo guys who had long careers and made a lot of money good work if you can get itmuch less fun to play withnot reallyclarkson in the league for years already from team to team he learned how to be in his bench scoring roleclarson still gets assists not his fault that he played in a terrible teamclarkson is still a starting level player in the league this guy not so muchwhats even funnier about the nets situation is that theyre still far below the salary floor in theory they should just sign thomas to a generous contract to meet their cba obligations the fact that they wont tells you how much they hate cam thomasi usually agree with lowe but i think its sometimes a trap to put guys into easy archetypes like th or th scoring burst off the bench you can see everyone taking their cue from lowe and saying different versions of the same thing i think theres a good chance that thomas can be more than that scoring gets short shrift now because of analytics to the point where i feel like its undervalued eg kobe getting trashed bc of his ts but thomas is a bucket and i wonder if his efficiency profile improves when he isnt the only guy who can get a bucket not to mention the nets were better on offense when he was on the floor offset by his bad d he was a net well see how his career unfolds but i think its too early to write thomas off as a microwave bench scorerthe nets hate him so much hes gotten starter minutes for years this is the problem with nba discourse man even analysts go on vibes more than realitydont test me i am not someone you want to make an enemy of speaking to me that way who the hell do you think you aregod his vague threats and self inflated ego are so tiringevery time you guys talk about him he has succeeded in doing his job dont give his words power please theres so much basketball content out there guys choose to talk about better shityall claim to be so tired of sas but when there is a video that has nothing to do with him a comment about him is the most upvoted commentthis is why sas is paid big money and is never going awayits like you said wed have already listened to his rants aka it gets clicks so he keeps doing ityour bar being sas means hes done his job perfectlyno is this was sas then this sub would lose their mind that he was being critical of a player instead lowe can say whatever and people get on their kneesi think the main difference is most of those guys would be happy if cam thomas or any player called them out like this theyd be like good this idiot just gave my content whereas i think zach lowe is probably a little upset about itpeople on the team sub used to talk about him like the next kobe lately its gotten more realistic but people were high on this dudethomas is more talented as a on scorer especially in the midrange but pritchard is a much better point shooter and always will be i think every single contender would rather have pritchard considering his role and how he fits with starssome guys get it some guys dont some guys have rings some guys dont payton was the man in high school and at oregon had to fight to become a rotation piece and now hes a time moy and a nba champ i hope cam is willing to slide into a less glamorous roleguy who exclusively watches payton pritchard highlights trying to make a player comparisonnot like pritchard is lock down but he is definitely impressive on defense for an undersized white guyhe also would almost definitely average ppg at least if he was on a bad team like thomas isi know who wants relatively even handed analysis when we could have more of perk and stephen a smith debate whether haliburton has a champions mindsetl takeshocking that a guy with the most listened to basketball podcast in the world would have a platformbecause hes extremely knowledgable and pretty entertainingwhats wrong with what he has said about cam thomasif anything we need more people like lowe he said he watched film of over cam thomas picknroll possessions just to make sure his opinions were grounded in fact who else in the nba media would do thathes not wrong on camimo hes the cream of the crop of knowledge basketball centered discussion level headed and doesnt do bs hot takes unless its on tue nose usuallyyoure a top commentor youre doing the same thing he does but for free and with less credibilitybecause he is damn good at his job dare i say he is better at his job than cam thomas is at playing basketballcant wait to hear the others you think are people like zach lowecuz you need to balance out the stephen a smiths and skip bayless with people who have a brainwhat zach is one of the smartest bball minds that has a mic in front of them right now what the fuck are you even talking aboutits easy to throw stones who do you likebecause hes one of the bestplenty of barstool chuds for you to meme with if real analysts arent your thingthat seems more and more like a badge of honor these days a great team has a guy like caruso first off the benchthat analysis depends on fit cam thomas can be that level of guy just for a team with a lot of offensive flaws caruso on the nuggets doesnt solve a lot of offensive problems thomas on the nuggets is probably a better version of what westbrook just didcam johnson is like smart mpj cam thomas is like jordan pooleyeah clarkson is a beast on kits in my opinion he chooses when to play hard like beasleyi think he honestly had the skill set to take over if he really wanted tothomas had more assistsgm last year their career numbers are and assists a game aint the difference you feel like it isif jordan clarkson is starting on your team in you aint winning shitclarkson is not a starting level player for a full season theres a reason hes not being offered that rolecam scored more ppg this season on better efficiency why is this sub acting like cam bout to go play in chinatbh there might be some incentive there if youre clever since the money up to the salary floor goes to rostered players afaik it could have changed probably did because its fucking mad science so in theory if you knew you werent gonna hit the floor you could pay more in a particular year than typical escalations allowit hasnt happened so its probably not really a thing but if i were a low salary team id look at thati dont think any team with playoff aspirations is ever going to feature cam thomas as a top option he is not a winning basketball playera guy like zach lavine who has cams ability plus more athleticism and efficiency also can function as an off ball shooter is still somewhat of a losing player so idk what you think cam has in himexcept weve seen cams archetype dozens of times before anfernee simons can whitmore bones hyland etc i highly doubt an undersized guard with bad defensive habits has that much more of a skill jump in him the most he can do is be more efficientyeah i guess the assessment comes with the assumption that as they grow as a player its in the expected trajectory that theyre already on and not improving more or in other facets of basketball i think a good example of unexpectedly good development is ant and his playmaking then shootingthe nets hate him so much they drafted guards and wont offer him more than a year extension with a team optionhes not in their long term plans at alli was just talking to my good friendmichael jordanand the topic of cam thomas came up i dont know how it did it just did you know ha ha you knowand he was telling me you know stephen a they called me a ball hog but that man is a ball hogand i slapped mike on the shoulder and said you rightits like im there hes like hulk hogan love him or hate him he is the immortal oneto the more informed and articulate go the spoilsyeah hes not content brained hes basketball brainedfans are always high on dumb selfish players who can only score some delusional people in the rockets sub were so high on cam whitmore like he is the best asset we got he will be our best player he is already better than jalen he should start albeit not the majority of people and now this season we realized they are not worth shit whitmore got traded for a nd rounder or something no team wanted him even for late st rounders apparently sexton got traded for nothing simons got traded for a bad contract and they had to throw in nds now cam is not getting a good contractpossibly fantasy players bleeding into reality i know people who liked him during his break out for all the points hahaits actually pretty easy paytons no starter but hes a right play passer with an occasional dime an active engaged defender if not particularly good and great on the boardspaytons probably less likely to turn to in a couple minutes but hes can however hes gonna give you something if his shots not falling and when it is falling hes nastywhen did he win moy twicethe difference between cam and payton is like an ocean on defense mazzulla put payton on franz wagner in the playoffs and locked him uppritchard also randomly gets a ton of offensive rebounds for a guy his size very smart positioning and does not give up even a littlealmost like that was a terrible comparison op madei swear the peeps on here that complain about when players get called out are actually nba players going anonymous and getting butt hurtits like they always act like they are getting personally attacked for having people tell them they arent perfecthe just called out people who use unnamed sources then gave his friend a pass for it because hes sitting right in front of him hes just a fuckin clown his friends like oo i did that and hes like not you rob donald trump is the president of the united states that means he deserves it idk the guy who just called out people for using unnamed scouts then just gives the guy a pass for it after he says he did it doesnt seem very credible to meso the guy who just called out people for using unnamed scouts in their articles then the guy goes i did that and he goes not you rob is the one with the brain very interesting deleted get off your kneesunclog your throattruthfully most of the mainstream sports media is truly terrible and i dont listen to any of it i havent turned on espn to watch sports center or a show in years i can form my own opinions on these things i dont need a guy getting paid by espn to spend days talking about cam thomas then say you dont think hes that good why are you talking about him so much if hes not that good im sure espn isnt pushing him to talk about the brooklyn nets their pushing him to talk about cam thomas cause theres drama involved nowreal analysts you got something on your chincaruso will be great fit with jokic cam thomas and jokic is defensive disasterpeople talk about cts passing too much but its really his defense thats holding him backwestbrook is a much better playmaker than thomas thomas is more in the lou williamsjamal crawford bucket getter kind of th man not really the same role westbrook playsi mean murray used to be a better thomas its that hes become a worse thomas or equivalent maybe a little better im not gonna dig cam thomas is like jordan poolefor straight years poole has averaged more assists than thomass injury shortened best year poole often was getting end of shot clock grenade passes for the wiz and still averaged more assistsi meant as a teammate thomas has definitely improved as a playmaker just two seasons ago clarkson was better in assist than thomas last year they were tied and it was mostly thomas improving his number but thats his ceiling to me sixth man off bench like clarksonbecause nobody in here watches basketball besides like their own team when they play the lakers lolit has happened multiple times in recent years with the thunderthats the key here the guy above is failing to address lowe stated in plainly that he can be the high ppg guy on a shitty team aka a tank commander but he very nicely slots into that off the bench offensive injection on an otherwise slow shooting night rolei dont think zach lavine is a losing player i think hes just grossly overpaid we would all love him if he was getting m to be the th best player on a team rd scoring option like if you swapped him for middleton on that giannisjruebrook team they still win and i think theyre just flat out betteralso cam thomas is the only one that can go out and prove zach wrong and change the narrative being butt hurt about someones opinion isnt going to change realityclaims of hulk hogans immortality seem to have been greatly exaggerated you could tell that his immediate reaction was to be disappointed that he was seemingly getting lumped in with the sasperks of the world when he was actually making a reasonable take based on an incredible amount of wellearned knowledge about the gameyep agreed another contributer is its honestly fun to watch someone like cam when theyre playing a good game his value toward a win is one thing because his weaknesses are pretty bad but watching someone sink tons of contested shots is always gonna be impressiveentertaining to mefans have a harder time taking things like attitude and work ethic into consideration because we mostly only see guys playing in games and not their affect on the locker room disputes with coaches etche saw the script and forgot it hasnt happened yetforgive me naz reid hasnt had quite the season i expected i completely forgot he won the year priorgreat defensive rebounder for a pg tooreally a super strong all around player who just happens to be a short white guy gonna be the worst guy to run into at the y in a dozen years or i mean pritchard is probably the current nba prototype of th man guard that can fill it up spark plug off the bench which is what lowe is suggesting thomas should be definitely not a comparison to thomas right now though the player or one of his cronieskd and colangelo really put in perspective how petty these personalities can be like who the fuck is defending cam thomas of all players this hard lol has to be thenselves his agent or their buddiesthat is all you got from this videohe was doing a hypothetical and was talking to the writers the not you rob was a not you specifically but writers in generali like how you think thats an apt comparison or some gotchya take that makes genuine sense to makethe usa deserves trump after electing him twicethats why youre who you are and why he is what he isits great you feel that way free opinion manthe doesnt seem credible part is the opinion i was poking atwhy not even a rofledit a haha evenname yoursfound the edge lord everyonecam thomas would be who you play when jokic is off the courtin the game where wemby dropped on the wizards jordan poole dropped on the spurs it was very impressive mitch johnson had to put wemby back in later in the th quarter because the wizards were pretty rapidly closing the gapmeh hes still just a chucker without much bb iq its not like assists is going to qualify someone as a floor general anyways and cam thomas assist rate this year wasnt much worse than pooleyeah i mean i think you dont win as your first option but if he was like rd next to giannis or ant the story is a lot different imo hes getting the same empty calorie accusation booker gets cuz the team was asslike imagine bringing his scoring down to orlandoas long as theres value to finishing low in the standings there will always be a team willing to pay cam thomas million on a shortterm deal to get buckets and lose games for him to take on that bench role hed have to develop some selfawareness might take a few years if everrespect khah money u may be right tho id like to think that he got frustrated because the contract negotiations arent going well and lost his temper for a moment though i do find it funny that guys like cam are always going on and on about how theyre never afraid to shoot a shot because they work on it and theyre confident and all that now all of a sudden he wants to be known as a playmaker too lolit might be paytonwhite with simmons off the bench thoedit or whatever his name is im too lazy to lookyeah hes talking out of his ass and clearly isnt objective just goes with emotions and feelings and he just showed it in real time the usa my brother in christ tens of millions voted against the cheeto including myself do we have issues oh fuck yeah but to lump million people together and say we deserve it is crazy what its not an opinion it literally just happened enjoy your day thothats only like minutes per gamesomeone here is def in their feelings of your country sat out in the last electionso yes collectively the usa deserves it the surest online sign of low intelligenceand percent of canada didnt vote in the last election welcome to elections where most people dont give a shit literally makes our country no different than any otherok so you have fairly low intelligence then by your own logic and percent of canada didnt vote in the last electionso i participated and am not complaining about the outcomethe original point was about donald trump deserving to be the presidenthe does he won the electionsucks for everyone but you guys fucked it upepic sauce bruhthe usa deserves trump after electing him twicedude you are moving the goalposts also i was never complaining just making a point you are terrible at arguing',\n",
