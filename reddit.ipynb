Say I want to highlight land the public can access, so first I get BLM land and state land data.\\xa0 Then say I want to highlight just the rivers in those areas. Last, some wetland areas are protected for endangered species, so I'd get data from a third agency to mark those areas as off limits. What I want to do is a little more complicated and involves more data sources but that's the basics.\\xa0\\n\\n\\nI think I need a way to make a base map. Then add layers for the different data sets. Probably have to covert between different map data types. Then have those layers interact in a way to visually display the end result I'm interested in, I.E. only highlight rivers on public land, green if I can perform the activity I'm interested in, red if not. It's not a fishing app, but think similar activity and multiple places to look up the rules. Then a tool to pin locations, and notes or pictures etc.\\n\\n\\nAny advice on how to get started?\\xa0\",\n",

Or wished your data visualizations would automatically update when parameters change?\\n\\nWhile specialized platforms like [Marimo](https://marimo.io/) offer reactive notebooks, you don\\'t need to leave the Jupyter ecosystem to get these benefits. With the `reaktiv` library, you can add reactive computing to your existing Jupyter notebooks and VSCode notebooks!\\n\\nIn this article, I\\'ll show you how to leverage `reaktiv` to create reactive computing experiences without switching platforms, making your data exploration more fluid and interactive while retaining access to all the tools and extensions you know and love.\\n\\n# Full Example Notebook\\n\\nYou can find the complete example notebook in the reaktiv repository:\\n\\n[reactive\\\\_jupyter\\\\_notebook.ipynb](https://github.com/buiapp/reaktiv/blob/main/examples/reactive_jupyter_notebook.ipynb)\\n\\nThis example shows how to build fully reactive data exploration interfaces that work in both Jupyter and VSCode environments.\\n\\n# What is reaktiv?\\n\\n[Reaktiv](https://github.com/buiapp/reaktiv) is a Python library that enables reactive programming through automatic dependency tracking. It provides three core primitives:\\n\\n1. **Signals**: Store values and notify dependents when they change\\n2. **Computed Signals**: Derive values that automatically update when dependencies change\\n3. **Effects**: Run side effects when signals or computed signals change\\n\\nThis reactive model, inspired by modern web frameworks like Angular, is perfect for enhancing your existing notebooks with reactivity!\\n\\n# Benefits of Adding Reactivity to Jupyter\\n\\nBy using `reaktiv` with your existing Jupyter setup, you get:\\n\\n* **Reactive updates** without leaving the familiar Jupyter environment\\n* **Access to the entire Jupyter ecosystem** of extensions and tools\\n* **VSCode notebook compatibility** for those who prefer that editor\\n* **No platform lock-in** \\\\- your notebooks remain standard .ipynb files\\n* **Incremental adoption** \\\\- add reactivity only where needed\\n\\n# Getting Started\\n\\nFirst, let\\'s install the library:\\n\\n    pip install reaktiv\\n    # or with uv\\n    uv pip install reaktiv\\n\\nNow let\\'s create our first reactive notebook:\\n\\n# Example 1: Basic Reactive Parameters\\n\\n    from reaktiv import Signal, Computed, Effect\\n    import matplotlib.pyplot as plt\\n    from IPython.display import display\\n    import numpy as np\\n    import ipywidgets as widgets\\n    \\n    # Create reactive parameters\\n    x_min = Signal(-10)\\n    x_max = Signal(10)\\n    num_points = Signal(100)\\n    function_type = Signal(\"sin\")  # \"sin\" or \"cos\"\\n    amplitude = Signal(1.0)\\n    \\n    # Create a computed signal for the data\\n    def compute_data():\\n        x = np.linspace(x_min(), x_max(), num_points())\\n        \\n        if function_type() == \"sin\":\\n            y = amplitude() * np.sin(x)\\n        else:\\n            y = amplitude() * np.cos(x)\\n        \\n        return x, y\\n    \\n    plot_data = Computed(compute_data)\\n    \\n    # Create an output widget for the plot\\n    plot_output = widgets.Output(layout={\\'height\\': \\'400px\\', \\'border\\': \\'1px solid #ddd\\'})\\n    \\n    # Create a reactive plotting function\\n    def plot_reactive_chart():\\n        # Clear only the output widget content, not the whole cell\\n        plot_output.clear_output(wait=True)\\n        \\n        # Use the output widget context manager to restrict display to the widget\\n        with plot_output:\\n            x, y = plot_data()\\n            \\n            fig, ax = plt.subplots(figsize=(10, 6))\\n            ax.plot(x, y)\\n            ax.set_title(f\"{function_type().capitalize()} Function with Amplitude {amplitude()}\")\\n            ax.set_xlabel(\"x\")\\n            ax.set_ylabel(\"y\")\\n            ax.grid(True)\\n            ax.set_ylim(-1.5 * amplitude(), 1.5 * amplitude())\\n            plt.show()\\n            \\n            print(f\"Function: {function_type()}\")\\n            print(f\"Range: [{x_min()}, {x_max()}]\")\\n            print(f\"Number of points: {num_points()}\")\\n    \\n    # Display the output widget\\n    display(plot_output)\\n    \\n    # Create an effect that will automatically re-run when dependencies change\\n    chart_effect = Effect(plot_reactive_chart)\\n\\nNow we have a reactive chart!

When you call a signal inside a computed function or effect, `reaktiv` records this dependency. Later, when a signal\\'s value changes, it notifies only the dependent computed values and effects.\\n\\nThis creates a reactive computation graph that efficiently updates only what needs to be updated, similar to how modern frontend frameworks handle UI updates.\\n\\nHere\\'s what happens when you change a parameter in our examples:\\n\\n1. You call `x_min.set(-5)` to update a signal\\n2. The signal notifies all its dependents (computed values and effects)\\n3. Dependent computed values recalculate their values\\n4. Effects run, updating visualizations or outputs\\n5. The notebook shows updated results without manually re-running cells\\n\\n# Best Practices for Reactive Notebooks\\n\\nTo ensure your reactive notebooks work correctly in both Jupyter and VSCode environments:\\n\\n1. **Use Output widgets for visualizations**: Always place plots and their related outputs within dedicated Output widgets\\n2. **Set explicit dimensions for output widgets**: Add height and border to ensure visibility:output = widgets.Output(layout={\\'height\\': \\'400px\\', \\'border\\': \\'1px solid #ddd\\'})\\n3. **Keep references to Effects**: Always assign Effects to variables to prevent garbage collection.\\n4. **Use context managers with Output widgets**\\n\\n# Benefits of This Approach\\n\\nUsing `reaktiv` in standard Jupyter notebooks offers several advantages:\\n\\n1. **Keep your existing workflows** \\\\- no need to learn a new notebook platform\\n2. **Use all Jupyter extensions** you\\'ve come to rely on\\n3. **Work in your preferred environment** \\\\- Jupyter Lab, classic Notebook, or VSCode\\n4. **Share notebooks normally** \\\\- they\\'re still standard .ipynb files\\n5. **Gradual adoption** \\\\- add reactivity only to the parts that need it\\n\\n# Troubleshooting\\n\\nIf your visualizations don\\'t appear correctly:\\n\\n1. **Check widget height**: If plots aren\\'t visible, try increasing the height in the Output widget creation\\n2. **Widget context manager**: Ensure all plot rendering happens inside the `with output_widget:` context\\n3. **Variable retention**: Keep references to all widgets and Effects to prevent garbage collection\\n\\n# Conclusion\\n\\nWith `reaktiv`, you can bring the benefits of reactive programming to your existing Jupyter notebooks without switching platforms. This approach gives you the best of both worlds: the familiar Jupyter environment you know, with the reactive updates that make data exploration more fluid and efficient.\\n\\nNext time you find yourself repeatedly running notebook cells after parameter changes, consider adding a bit of reactivity with `reaktiv` and see how it transforms your workflow!\\n\\n# Resources\\n\\n* [reaktiv GitHub repository](https://github.com/buiapp/reaktiv)\\n* [reaktiv Documentation](https://reaktiv.readthedocs.io/)\\n* [Jupyter Notebooks](https://jupyter.org/)\\n* [ipywidgets Documentation](https://ipywidgets.readthedocs.io/)\\n* [VSCode Jupyter Extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-toolsai.jupyter)',\n",

It protects your app from common web vulnerabilities like SQL injection, XSS, path traversal, and more. üõ°Ô∏è\\n\\n---\\n\\n### **What My Project Does:**\\n\\nFlaskGuard analyzes incoming HTTP requests in real-time and blocks malicious patterns such as SQL injection, XSS, path traversal, command injection, and more. It's designed to act as a security layer for any Flask web app with minimal setup required.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### **Target Audience:**\\n\\nThis project is meant for **Flask developers** who are building production-ready applications and want a lightweight but effective first line of defense against common web threats. Whether you're running a small API or a larger web service, FlaskGuard can help secure it.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### **Comparison:**\\n\\nUnlike more complex full-stack WAFs or security middleware that require external setups (like ModSecurity), **FlaskGuard** is built purely in Python, installs via `pip`, and integrates directly with Flask. It requires zero configuration to get started but is fully extensible for advanced users.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### **üîí Features:**\\n\\n- Detects and blocks malicious requests.\\n- ‚öôÔ∏è Configurable rules and whitelisting.\\n- üß© Seamless Flask integration.\\n- üìÑ Logging with color-coded output for quick threat analysis.\\n- üß† Supports detection of common vulnerabilities.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### **üì¶ Installation:**\\n\\nFrom PyPI:\\n\\n```bash\\npip install safe-flask\\n```\\n\\nFrom GitHub:\\n\\n```bash\\npip install git+https://github.com/CodeGuardianSOF/FlaskGuard.git\\n```\\n\\n---\\n\\n### **üìö Example Usage:**\\n\\n```python\\nfrom flask import Flask\\nfrom flask_guard import FlaskGuard\\n\\napp = Flask(__name__)\\nFlaskGuard(app)\\n\\n@app.route('/')\\ndef home():\\n    return 'Hello, FlaskGuard!'\\n```\\n\\n---\\n\\n### **üîó GitHub Repo:**\\n\\nhttps://github.com/CodeGuardianSOF/FlaskGuard\\n\\n---\\n\\n### **üìù License:**\\n\\nMIT License\\n\\n---\\n\\n### **üôè Feedback:**\\n\\nI'd love to hear your thoughts, suggestions, or any issues you encounter. Feel free to open an issue or contribute to the project!\\n\",\n",
       "  'Comments': [{'body': 'First thing I noticed: why is your Python package named safe-flask, despite it providing the module flask_guard? That\\'s pretty confusing in my opinion.\\n\\nPersonally, I don\\'t think that using this would be a good idea, unless you can give far more proof that your library works effectively to block malicious requests without preventing regular users from making these requests. What I find especially concerning here is the lack of a test suite, meaning you have no way of easily validating that your library blocks malicious requests.\\n\\nFirstly, your library blocks many non-malicious requests. On a veterinary website, a request to /pets?species=cat will be blocked.\\n\\nAdditionally, there are some pretty obvious security flaws in your software, which makes it easy for an attacker to avoid your middleware\\'s checks entirely. For example, by setting \"safe_param=value\" in the query and setting my user agent to curl (regardless of my actual HTTP client), my request will skip all of your checks. Even if you fix that, your library is incredibly easy to bypass for most attacks anyway. For example, you can bypass the SQLI just by doing something like \"OR 42=42\" instead of \"OR 1=1\".\\n\\nThis could be a fun project for your own learning, but no sane person would ever use it in production. Honestly, the project has ***MAJOR AI slop vibes***. There\\'s no testing, emojis everywhere, and nothing works beyond your simple examples in the readme. It uses basic regular expressions for matching malicious requests, and those regular expressions are incredibly easy for attackers to bypass, but are basic enough that they can easily be triggered by regular users.\\n\\nIf you\\'re learning to program, don\\'t be disheartened: this is a great project for learning more about security and web servers, and I encourage you to keep improving it to reduce false positives and false negatives. A test suite is a good place to start if you want it to be anything more than a toy.\\n\\nIf you\\'re just spewing out AI slop though, please stop. There are better solutions for this problem that already exist, and AI will not compare to the ability of a human software engineer (despite what marketers with no real programming experience will tell you). AI cannot be trusted when it comes to writing correct code, especially when security is involved. When it comes to implementing security features, you should never roll-your-own.',\n",

Let\\'s break that down real quick:\\n\\n*   **Deployment View:** Yeah, it deploys as one thing. That\\'s the \"monolith\" part everyone sees.\\n*   **Logical View:** This is where *you* win with the modular approach. You\\'re organizing your code into clean modules (`users`, `notifications`, etc.) inside that single deployment. Think clear boundaries, less spaghetti code. Makes life way easier for maintenance and adding features.\\n\\n**So, how do modules talk without turning back into spaghetti?**\\n\\nYou don\\'t want `users` code directly calling `notifications` code - that kills the benefits. Forget event buses for a sec (they have their place, but let\\'s try something database-focused first).\\n\\n**Database Schemas + Views + Autonomous Modules:**\\n\\nThink of it like this: let the `notifications` module figure stuff out on its own, using controlled access to data.\\n\\n1.  **Schema per Module:** Give each module its own Postgres schema (`users_schema`, `notifications_schema`). Like separate rooms in the house.\\n2.  **DB Users per Module:** Each module talks to its *own* schema with a DB user that only has permissions *there*.\\n3.  **Views are the Contract:** If `notifications` needs user info, the `users` module creates a read-only View (like `users_schema.vw_users_needing_welcome_email`) showing *only* what `notifications` needs. No touching the raw tables. This View is the official way `users` shares data.\\n4.  **Read-Only Access:** The `notifications` module gets a DB user that can *only* read from that specific View in `users_schema`.\\n\\n**How Notifications Work (Polling / Checking State):**\\n\\nNow, `notifications` doesn\\'t wait to be told exactly what to do. It checks for work itself:\\n\\n1.  **Track Own Work:** `notifications` keeps a list of who it already emailed in its own schema (e.g., `notifications_schema.sent_welcome_emails` table).\\n2.  **Check for Pending Work (The Logic):** This runs somehow (see triggers below):\\n    *   Get eligible users: `SELECT user_id, email FROM users_schema.vw_users_needing_welcome_email`.\\n    *   Get already sent list: `SELECT user_id FROM notifications_schema.sent_welcome_emails`.\\n    *   Figure out who\\'s new: Find the difference.\\n    *   Process the new ones:\\n        *   **Lock the row** using `SELECT ... FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED` (super important, see below).\\n        *   Queue the actual email send using a background task runner (Celery, ARQ, FastAPI\\'s thing). Don\\'t send email directly in this logic!\\n        *   Mark as done in `notifications_schema.sent_welcome_emails` (still holding the lock).\\n\\n**How to Trigger the Check:**\\n\\n*   **Option A: Simple Polling:** Just have a background job run the \"Check for Pending Work\" logic every minute or so.\\n    *   **Good:** Easy, super robust, modules stay really separate.\\n    *   **Bad:** Emails aren\\'t instant, depends on how often you poll.\\n\\n*   **Option B: Use `LISTEN / NOTIFY` as a Kick:**\\n    *   When `users` creates/updates someone relevant, its transaction just does `NOTIFY \\'stuff_for_notifications_to_check\\';`. No data needed, just a simple ping.\\n    *   A separate listener process for `notifications` just sits there doing `LISTEN \\'stuff_for_notifications_to_check\\';`.\\n    *   When it gets pinged, it runs the *exact same* \"Check for Pending Work\" logic as in Option A.\\n    *   **Good:** Much faster trigger than waiting for polling. Still reliable because it runs the full check.\\n    *   **Bad:** You have to manage that listener process (make sure it\\'s running, reconnects, etc.).\\n\\n*   **Best Bet: Use Both A and B Together!**\\n    *   Seriously, this is often the way. Use `LISTEN/NOTIFY` (Option B) to get fast triggers most of the time.\\n    *   Also keep the simple polling job (Option A) running less often (e.g., every 5-10 mins). This acts as a backup - it guarantees that even if the `NOTIFY` signal gets lost somehow, the work *will* eventually get picked up. Speed + certainty.\\n\\n**Quick Notes on the Postgres Bits:**\\n\\n*   **`LISTEN / NOTIFY`:** Good for that low-latency \"Hey, wake up and check for work\" ping. Don\\'t send data with it, just use it as a trigger signal combined with polling for safety.\\n*   **`SELECT ... FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED`:** Use this when your checking logic fetches rows to process. It locks the specific rows so two background workers don\\'t accidentally grab the *same* user at the *same* time. `SKIP LOCKED` means if another worker already locked a row, just skip it and grab the next available one. Prevents race conditions and double-sends. Absolutely key if you run more than one worker instance.\\n\\n**Wrap Up:**\\n\\nThis database-centric way gives you strong separation between modules using schemas and views. Trigger the work check using polling, `LISTEN/NOTIFY`, or ideally both combined. And use `SELECT FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED` to handle concurrency safely. It\\'s a really solid pattern for modular monoliths.\\n\\nGood luck with it!',\n",

       "   {'body': 'I would like to be as concrete about this as possible, but I will serve and treat this as a question, which I wonder if this is a phenomenon between an automatic and a manual mindset/play-style?\\xa0\\n\\nLike for example, if a player who does well in the regular season, but then gets into the playoffs where the lights are much brighter, they would most definitely get anxious over the pressure that it can in-still into you in the big picture. And that makes me believe that they often switch to a ‚Äòmanual‚Äô play as a result, where their actions are more conscious and self-directed, as if they are thinking: ‚ÄúOk, I must make sure my form is great, I must be able to get this shot off at this angle‚Ä¶‚Äù.\\n\\nWhat results in this mindset is the mental \\xa0and physical dissociation between the court and yourself, you play at a level that is not on contention with what others are doing, and you are not fully aware of it. Thus, your skill that should haven been better, is not, because you have lost that ability that helps you which is your practice of the game and the talent to which you have.\\n\\nThat last sentence is what separates the manual play to an automatic play, in which you allow that what you have practiced and have shown previously be your foundational constant. You have that skill, you have shown that skill in the unconscious, and now that you are here under the bright lights, you should trust it and focus on what you can do to win with what you have.\\xa0\\n\\nIt feels like players like James Harden, the NHL‚Äôs Connor Hellebuyck (Jets goaltender) and Auston Matthews (Maple Leafs captain), and many others never learned or were even taught this effectively. They just don‚Äôt trust themselves, they look to be consciously evaluating their talent and skill in the moment and not the decisions of the play\\xa0around them. They rely on a structured game that fits their mentality (like the 5 minute Power Play the Maple Leafs had against the Ottawa Senators in this years‚Äô playoff series), but when the game changes, it shuts down their instincts, as if their conscious is blocking their unconscious decision to chase it back because your structure is not there anymore or has failed you.\\n\\nThat is where, I think, that choking often happens. But maybe I am missing something, so I just want clarification or a different view because this is incredibly interesting to me.',\n",

I have applied to 200+ data science jobs with no success, not even a first round interview.\\n\\nWhile my degree is geology in name my daily work is more related computer science, applied math, and physics than geology. The only relationship I have to geology is that I used the tools from the other disciplines to solve a problem in geology, and I took some required graduate geology coursework. In fact, my subdiscipline is technically computational geoscience, I've published in data science journals, and the vast majority of my graduate coursework was in the math and computer science departments. While getting my PhD I also worked on a major DoD project as a data scientist and built 30+ models during that time, both machine learning and statistical. This is also not including my PhD research where I developed new computational methods using machine learning techniques and solved a long standing issue in soft matter physics. I could also be considered a SME in applying data science and machine learning methods to environmental and national security problems (and to a lesser extent financial problems due to some other work that I've done).\\n\\nI suppose my question is this: Is the job market really that bad right now for data scientists that despite my background I can't even get an interview for an entry level data analyst or data scientist job?

       "   {'body': '> I feel like the students with a SWE/DS degree are heavily preferred.\\xa0\\n\\n\\nThat was my impression, too, albeit 3 years ago.\\n\\n\\n\\nCompanies don\\'t need very many data scientists, however they often do need people who can design/implement the infrastructure. For many companies, data science only generates\\xa0value\\xa0when they\\'ve reached a certain level of data maturity. Not every company needs a DS, and for the rest I\\'d think that competition will be high or rather: the actually available position will be few.\\n\\n\\n\\nPersonally, I think projects are a good way to learn and grow but I\\'d suggest to\\xa0try and do them at work, working with \"proper\" data. For many companies, the value of data work lies in leveraging the subject matter expertise and finding ways to find new insights and applications. Alternatively, value lies in data engineering - which you already figured out.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe way I approached Data Science, personally, was to find projects that were valuable for the company / department that I worked at. In short: implementing a database, doing the data cleaning and harmonisation, building a small business intelligence pipeline as well as the consulting and stakeholder work that I did along the way.\\n\\n\\nI don\\'t want to overstate my work but in my small way my work transformed how my team and department operated on a daily basis. That generated better workflows and insights. You probably can only quantify some of the impact but my colleagues and bosses were happy for the change it brought, and found it valuable for their own work.\\n\\n\\nIn the three domains of programming, statistics and subject matter expertise, I mostly leveraged the latter and added programming to my skill list. Advanced stats don\\'t show up very often in my live of work.\\n\\n\\n\\nMy job today is niche but nowadays, I focus on the consulting, implementation and\\xa0automation aspects. More specifically, I\\'d like to get people from working in their separate excel tables to more integrated workflows. My focus for the future for myself will probably be on Operations Research and algorithmic work.\\n\\n\\n\\n> I tried to think about a few, but either: 1, the idea was done 100x already, so my project would be nothing new or 2, the data required would be too expensive to acquire.\\n\\n\\n\\nExactly, finding these usecases that are actually valuable is really difficult work! Being able to find that one usecase or that one aspect in a project that actually makes a difference is the key skill that makes a good data scientist.\\n\\n\\n\\nThat\\'s also why DS jobs often aren\\'t entry level but require previous working experience. If you can show within your current job that you can use your\\xa0DS skills to do work that goes beyond the normal responsibilities and expectations for your role, then you can show that you can create true value for your team or department. Then you\\'ll also have made a big step towards better employability.\\xa0\\n\\n\\nAny certificates that you\\xa0work on will only be useful in so far as the skills you learn with them enable you to (better) create value for others.',\n",

Then it should also make why people instead do what they do in practice, and let you work out the right answer or a good heuristic for any situation.\\n\\nYou can see the modelling task in a few different ways:\\n\\n1. Given some observables, can you predict a hidden value.\\n2. Given a past state, can you predict a future state.\\n\\nYou should decide which you are at least trying to do. They are not the same.\\n\\nUsually what you want to do is the second. If you had good data with all the timestamps etc, your situation would be easier - take the state of data at the point of \\'decision\\' and at the point of \\'outcome\\' and nothing in the former can be leakage. Even if the \\'conversion value\\' existed in the former state, it would not be leakage (eg maybe some reps set it eagerly). You would not even have to look in the data - it just follows from the modeling task and the data definition.\\n\\nPick the goal there and with ideal data, the correct answer should be obvious. From there you can work with dealing with the complicating realities.\\n\\nThat is for when you do actually have the full sequence of true events, which is rare.\\n\\nThe first modeling approach has valid applications but most of the time, analyses often treat the situation as #1 while they are actually trying to do #2. Sometimes just out of habit but often because you only have a snapshot of the data and lack proper data for events. That makes it clearer what we are trying to do - we are trying to simulate the causal process as in #2 using only a static snapshot as in #1.\\n\\nThis is the key that lets you answer whether there is \\'leakage\\'.\\n\\nIf you had another field like \"onboarding time\" (assuming this something you only do once converted), then that would be \\'leakage\\' for #2 but it would not be leakage for #1. The same is even true for things that would be set later in the process that you would normally not know at the time of decision - the model for when it needs to be applied would not have access to that data.\\n\\nIt is therefore also not enough to just look at the label that exactly replicates the conversion - you have to go through all of the categories and all of the other fields, and at least have some intuitive understanding of their causality. What is set at the point of decision (/conversion) vs after? If it is set after you have to deal with it or else your model is not predictive.\\n\\nThe simplest approach is to just identify which fields or which values would come from later in the process, then you want to censor those values.\\n\\n(Technically, if values can appear both before and after, you can also deal with that through eg likelihoods, but usually you just censor everything you\\'re worried about)\\n\\nFor the censoring, you obviously do not just blank the value because that has the same mutual information with the target.\\n\\nThat perspective also lets you note that just bunching the forbidden value into a category does not fix it as now that category now retains some of that mutual information.\\n\\nYou have to eliminate that connection.\\n\\nNaturally just removing any fields that could depend on the future would work but may be too aggressive.\\n\\nWhat you can do instead to censor, is to resample those values conditioned on not being one of the forbidden values. That will destroy the information and make the fields reusable.\\n\\nIn practice, this is often not modeled, instead replaced with e.g. the most common alternative value or resampled from the empirical distribution independently; but even just a simple model seems sensible.\\n\\nThat is how you can deal with the categories but it extends to all fields - do not assume there is not leakage elsewhere.\\n\\n(Note that this also gives you an obvious approach for if you want to make predictions between different points of eg a sales cycle)\\n\\n(Ofc the above is still not the right way to model - usually we want to model how some intervention, eg which campaign, influences the target)',\n",
